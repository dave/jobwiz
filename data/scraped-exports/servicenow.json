After this year I was moved to a Junior position but it seems to not correspond to my real level of expertise and this is where I'm conflicted.\n\nAlthough I only have around 1 year of work experience, throughout this year I didn't have any senior or even mid level dev to train me. I was the one to manage all the projects, go to meetings, gather requirements, translate them into technical documentation, implement, do QA and deliver. I learned how to use the tool by myself and by attending some training, but most of it was rather useless as I had already learnt most of it.\n\nI've interviewed with some other companies and they were really surprised with what I accomplished this year and they all wanted me to join them as a mid level dev with prospects of going senior and managing a team in the near future (reason I didn't join them is it involved relocation which I would prefer to avoid right now).\n\nI have a bunch of responsibilities that aren't characteristic of those of a Junior dev, but my manager says a good Junior is supposed to do that.

You're definitely a mid-level engineer and depending on the complexity of your projects you might be verging towards senior level.  You know what we call a \"good junior\"?  Mid-level.  And we pay them a lot more.\n\n* A junior engineer is someone who needs assistance from someone more senior in order to be able to make meaningful contributions.  They should not be managing projects or gathering requirements nor doing implementation solo on anything more than small features. \n* A mid-level engineer is someone who can mostly work independently.  They'll reach out to senior engineers for more complex things and lean on them for larger-scope product direction/design.  They may do larger features and smaller projects solo and participate in the project management/requirements process but shouldn't be driving it.\n* A senior engineer works without assistance (aside from code review) and can quite competently plan for long-term product direction.  They should be able to drive projects from the technical side and manage large projects, including helping direct/mentor mid level and junior engineers to bring the project to completion.  One sign of a senior engineer is that managers are asking them for judgement calls and will let them pick projects to put on the roadmap. \n* A principal engineer can tie together technical understanding of multiple complex product lines for a company to build the business and plan for new products.  The may also be responsible for a flagship product suite.  They should also be capable of carrying ideas through into new products.  They likely have a solid grasp of both the industry and the business ecosystem of a company.  At smaller companies a Principal Engineer could stand in for a CTO. ",

I know these kinds of posts get posted often, so I'll try to keep it short as possible.\n\nGraduated in 2018 and was jobless in tech industry until 3 months ago. Started first full-time job in tech 3 months ago at big company. Great pay and okay experience so far.\n\nYou might be wondering:\n\n**\"Why do you want to look for a new job if the pay is great and experience is decent so far?\"**\n\nTwo things: I got hired for and work with ServiceNow, and I have to always interview for projects. I don't like ServiceNow and don't like always having to interview for projects because it makes me feel like I don't even have a job.\n\n**\"Why did you take the job then if you don't like ServiceNow and interviewing for projects?\"**\n\nComplete and utter desperation. Being jobless for 2.5+ years after graduating college made me desperate; not Revature desperate though. I got tired of constantly applying for jobs and getting rejected with the added thought of feeling like a failure every day I didn't have a job in tech. Also, the interview was easy and the offer was damn near impossible to deny after being broke for a long time.\n\n**\"What jobs are you thinking about looking for?\"**\n\nI like front-end development and the occasional backend, but mostly front end. I don't want to get pigeon-holed into ServiceNow. ServiceNow under the hood is very outdated and monolithic IMO. It uses JS5 and has been for 7+ (?) years, so.....yeah.\n\n**\"What do you want us to tell you?\"**\n\nJust if you, or anyone you know, ever had the same experience of looking for a job after only working at your current job for a short period of time.

I started out in nursing for the first two years of my degree, and then swapped to MIS for the last two years. I have no real work or internship experience as I have been taking a full 18 credit hour course load every semester while also babysitting my nephew from 9 to 5 four days a week for the last year and a half. I realize for the benefit of my own career I should have asked my brother to find someone else to care for him, but I love my nephew and enjoyed experiencing his early life in the way that I have.\n\nThe courses that I enjoyed the most were those involving programming, learning languages like Python and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I have a minor in Application Development, in which I learned Swift and built a functional application that I'm relatively proud of. However, none of these classes ever went super in-depth due to the nature of the MIS program spreading itself thin to provide both business and IT courses.\n\nHonestly, I don't even know what I should be applying for. I've applied to a few entry level developer positions. One that seemed promising that I went through a few interview rounds for decided that I was not qualified enough as I had no specific Java experience. I wouldn't mind a role as a Business or System Analyst, but all of the positions that I have seen that are marked as \"entry level\" still require 5+ years of experience. Not sure where I would start with that, either.\n\nWhat would be the most reasonable place to start when applying for jobs with an MIS degree if I would like to be a developer? Should I try to go for a help desk position, or would that be selling myself short?\n\nI was also offered an interview for an entry level ServiceNow position. Would this be a good place to start, or should I be worried that I could get \"stuck\" learning ServiceNow while gaining no other experience?

I had a few friends at a previous company (SaaS marketing tech company) who were convinced they had to go from Support Engineer to Implementation Engineer before Software Engineer because that is what our company dictated.\n\nIf you do end up taking a role like that, continually work on your side projects and deepen your skillset, and start interviewing for software engineer roles no later than 6 months after you start.\n\nMy perspective going from Implementation Engineer to Software Engineer was that while there is overlap in technical knowledge, the day-to-day work and skills are completely different. I remember my manager telling me I had to \"master my current role before being considered for a transfer/promotion into a developer role\" and while I understood his perspective, it just made no sense to me because debugging random customer issues is completely different than designing and building apps to solve business problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Honestly, I don't even know what I should be applying for. I've applied to a few entry level developer positions. One that seemed promising that I went through a few interview rounds for decided that I was not qualified enough as I had no specific Java experience.\n\nIn my opinion, you should continue to apply for entry level developer positions. Being entry level is tough for most grads, wether they be CS, CS adjacent degrees like MIS, or bootcampers. Don't let one rejection stop you; you'll probably go through 20+ rejections before you get a job offer.\n\nMy general rule of thumb is to apply to positions that require less than three years of experience; most companies will consider new grads for those.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;However, none of these classes ever went super in-depth due to the nature of the MIS program spreading itself thin to provide both business and IT courses.\n\nContinue to work on your technical skills and figure out where your gaps are. I'd try to reach out to the company that rejected you and see if they'd provide any feedback or guidance on what you could work on (odds are they wont unfortunately, but it's worth a shot). Another way to figure out what you're bad at is to take the Triplebyte quiz. I'm not a huge fan of their operation, but what's nice is that after you fail the quiz, they'll tell you what to work on to improve and give you some resources.\n\nTake that feedback into account and continue to build apps that require skills/tools that you're inexperienced with. An app you can get passionate about building is the best way to learn quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I realize for the benefit of my own career I should have asked my brother to find someone else to care for him, but I love my nephew and enjoyed experiencing his early life in the way that I have.\n\nNow that you're finishing up school, you should definitely dedicate more time toward learning programming if you want to become a software engineer.\n\nThat being said, you shouldn't feel bad about not prioritizing programming 24/7. In the years ahead, you'll look back fondly at that time spent with your nephew, even if it means it takes you a few months longer to find your first job.\n\nI was in a constant state of grind for 2.5 years before I \"made it\" getting a job at a FAANG+/Big N/whatever-you-want-to-call-it company. In that time, I didn't prioritize my health or my social life enough. Once the pandemic is over, none of my free time will be spent coding, I'll be doing everything else. And since I moved back home during shelter-in-place. I'm spending a lot of time with my family, especially with my niece whom I see every week. No regrets there!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps, let me know if you have any more questions!",

      "body": "Throwaway account.\n\nThis happened about a year ago; just now talking about it because it was a painful experience. I interviewed at ServiceNow in Santa Clara for a dev position and got a great offer, which I immediately accepted. It was with a great team, and the manager and I really hit it off during the interview. During the onboarding process, they did a background search and drug test. I had been using medical marijuana for about a year (with a prescription); it didn't even cross my mind that it would be an issue since I have a prescription for it, and medical cannabis was legalized in California the year I was born. On top of that, I hadn't used in over a month. So when the drug test came back positive for THC, the HR/recruiter person called me and rescinded my offer. He followed up with an email that said:\n\n&gt; ServiceNow adheres to U.S. Federal law regarding drug testing. This means if a drug has been legalized at the state level, and not at the federal level, and an individual tests positive they will fail the drug test and be ineligible for employment at ServiceNow for at least one (1) year.\n\nIt was heartbreaking, and frustrating since I had informed all the other places I was interviewing at that I had accepted an offer at ServiceNow. It took another two months before I got another offer (this time from Salesforce). This time I was upfront with the Salesforce recruiter about my medical marijuana use; she laughed and said it's not an issue even it was recreational use. While it ended up working out ok for me (love my job at Salesforce!), I still felt terrible about this experience.\n\nThe ServiceNow recruiter cited their government contracts as the reason for the strict policy. But surely many other tech companies in the bay area that don't drug test also have government contracts, right? Salesforce certainly does; so do Google/Oracle and others, and none of them do drug tests. Is the \"government contract\" thing just an excuse for their policy? Sigh, anyway, doesn't matter now.\n\nMoral of the story: research the company's drug test policy before applying.",

I got an offer for a summer internship with **ServiceNow SDE Internship and Walmart SWE Internship (Bentonville, AR)** and I need some advice deciding between the two.\n\nI'm less concerned about getting a return offer from these two companies since my plan is to get one more internship before I graduate (I'm graduating in 2022) and hopefully have a strong foundation of internships before I apply for full time. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! I've asked a handful of people and they've all been swayed by the money for ServiceNow. However, I'm trying to think and weigh out whether or not the money is worth more than the experience I get out of the internship. **It's my first SWE internship and I only have a chance at one more internship (aside from this one) before I graduate so I've got to make it count!**\n\n*My concerns:*\n\n**ServiceNow:** I'm worried ServiceNow will limit me to their platform only and I'll be branded to SAAS and only have so much space to move to other SAAS companies (Salesforce, AWS, etc.) This is a main concern because I don't particularly now what I want to \\*do\\* yet. Also, I'm worried the projects I'll be working on don't involve much coding and so I won't have many talking points during my future interviews. This is for their IT department so I'm not sure what I'd be working with. I spoke to my supervisor and he said I'd mainly work on front-end type tasks but depending on how much I can accomplish during the 2-month internship I could be set for full-stack experience. The pay is better than average and there's great benefits (bonus, housing stipend despite remote, etc.). In addition, my team has been very attentive and responsive and I really adore my recruiter.\n\n**Walmart:** Most of my concerns for this internship is based on how vague it is. I'm not sure what I'd be working on (except knowing that I'll have an individual intern project that's expected to be delivered by the end of the internship). Let's get this straight -- this isn't Walmart Labs. The Walmart Labs team is located on the west coast and my team is situated in Bentonville, Arkansas. To further clarify, Walmart Labs is a part of Walmart Global Tech. But, my position is for Walmart Global Tech (mentioning this because people assume it's for Walmart Labs). The pay is okay ($22/hr) but I haven't had the greatest experience with my recruiter. I've heard that interns work on anything from front-end dev, mobile dev, ML/AI, etc all the way to basic site maintenance. I'm not sure what I'm getting myself into except the fact that it's Walmart Global Tech and that it's located in Arkansas. But hey, they're Fortune #1 right?\n\nIf you've read this far -- thank you. I'm a bit new to this and I don't have many people to look to for advice. If we have a cool convo I'd love to connect! Hope you guys haven't been going crazy in quarantine.",

I've applied to over 100 companies and only got 3 replies. One of them was Amazon who ghosted me after I finished OA3 (thought I did pretty good as well) and one of them is ServiceNow who not only missed our first interview, but when I sent an email to confirm our second interview they ghosted me and I haven't had that second interview either.  I managed to get a Google Interview a year ago but even they rejected me right away this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe its my resume? I've done an internship before and have lots of extra things on my resume. I've even won a bunch of hackathons and showcase them.

Having just one vague bullet point isn't very informative.\n\n\\- I'd move the certification section to be after your education section. It is valuable to have, but it's not going to be the deciding factor, unless the employer is specifically looking for candidates that have that specific certification.\n\nOtherwise you have a good resume, as a fellow unemployed person in tech.

      "title": "Jobs - Notes",
      "body": "I lurk on Reddit, browsing thru a few subs.. \n\nI see lot of candidates expressing concern on finding jobs. Here are some notes. Hope you find it useful.\n\nI work as a Senior Consultant is a fairly large IT Company. We have 50+ job opening at various levels (Technical Service Desk Agents, Developers, DevOps Engineers, Architects, Project Managers). We are unable to fill these, as we don't find qualified candidates. I am on the Interview Panel for some of these positions. In the last 2 months, I have conducted 45 tech Interviews, but rejected most of them \"not meeting the minimum job requirement\".\n\nAcross other positions, my co-workers also have rejected an equal number of candidates.\n\nMind you - these are not highly specialized skills. Majority of them are a few years' experience in skills like: Service Desk or Cloud or Developer DevOps or PM. Last week, one of our other units added 12 Serice Desk Trainees, for which they scouted for 2 months.\n\nThis post is to give an overview of how we do this and **also an encouragement to job seekers** (young and old), that from your side, you are finding \"market is tough\", \"you are not getting responses to your application\" etc., but looking at it from corporate side, we have several openings to be filled immediately, but we are not reaching or getting qualified candidates.\n\nHere are my notes:\n\n**Our Interview process** - Not extremely long. 1**) Recruiter** - receives the Resume 2**) Recruiter -** goes through your resume **3) Recruiter** - does an initial HR round 4**) Tech shortlist** - me or my colleague **5) First round Tech Interview** (30 mins to 1 hr.) 6**) Final round Tech Interview** - me or my colleague (minimum 1 hr.) **7) Final HR round** - for the offer letter, comp negotiations etc.  Notice - even for such a short process, a candidate is actually going through 7 evaluation rounds.\n\n  \nEach step is detailed below:\n\n1) **Recruiter - receives the resume** - LinkedIn, Indeed, Dice and through multiple third-party agencies (who get a commission for each candidate). Net Net: we source them from the market. Our recruiters are NOT based in offshore. They are all based in US getting paid to submit a good resume. They have targets for how effective they are in sourcing good resumes that clear the initial review. Our company has hired about 10+ recruiters (head hunters) to get resumes from the approved sources. We also have multiple referral programs for our internal employees. **My notes on this point** - If your resume is up there in the Job Portals or with any reputed recruitment agency, one of my recruiters will definitely get it. If you have friends or family, a referral will get your resume quickly to a Recruiter\n\n2) **Recruiters - goes through your resume** - The Recruiter / or the first Tech Eval person, matches the candidates resume with the Job Description / Requirements (we call it JR. Some people call it JD). Job Descriptions are NOT multiple pages. Just about 8-10 bullet points plus some paragraphs. **My notes on this point** - Read the Job Description, line by line and make sure that each point in the JR is reflected in the resume. It is ok to have on your resume first page, the JR and some annotation as to how you fit the JR perfectly. The recruiter looks at the match of your resume to Job Description and that is how the resume bubbles up, to be considered for shortlisting\n\n2a) **Resume Content / Quality / Quantity**: We don't worry about resume quality. Even spelling errors are acceptable by our recruiters or our Tech Panel. I am on the Tech Panel and never bother about spelling or grammar. Though it is good to have the discipline. As mentioned above, we first look at the JR match with resume. If the resume directly comes to me or my colleagues (who are billable at client projects), we don't match the resume with LinkedIn, but the recruiters sometimes verify the LinkedIn. So if you are posting a LinkedIn reference, match it as closely to the resume as possible (months, dates, designation, role etc.). We don;' fret if there are slight discrepancies, example you may be Project Lead, but you have mentioned as a Project Manager in LinkedIn. We get lot of AI written resumes. We have subscription for \"AI Detectors\". I don't reject AI resumes, but some of my coworkers reject all AI resumes. My suggestion, as much as possible avoid AI written resumes. You can go two steps. Get it written by AI. There are tools on the Web that convert AI resume to a human resume. Use those to make your final resume, so that the stricter evaluators don't land up rejecting the resume. What to put in your resume - We get wary with long resumes. We like to see, max a 3-page resume. Maybe half first page is - fitment to the Job description, then a half page highlight. Next 2 pages could be your work experience. Make sure that as much of the wolrk experience listed matches the Job Description. I got a resume today, for a DevOps Engineer. The resume says 2018-2020, they worked as Teaching assistant. and all the duties they have performed. while listing the duration-role is ok, no need to put the teaching highlights into this position. The last page SHOULD have your Certifications. All my colleagues look for Certifications.. I definitely look at Certifications.  In fact, for some position - example: ServiceNow Engineer or Google Kubernetes Engineer, I have cleared a few resumes like this, without even looking at the rest of the resume, because of the need for Certification for that position. More on Certifications later down. As far mentioning experience - we are mostly looking for immediate relevant experience. What the candidate has done 10-15 years ago is of minimal interest, unless it is relevant to the Job. For example - I saw for a full-stack developers, someone putting a 5 year Mainframe COBOL experience, done 15 years ago. Should be mentioned, but not in detail. Use that 3 page space effectively highlighting relevance and concurrency to the job Description. Also, what we don't need in the resume and not interested - your hobbies, your references etc.  Not at this point. Net Net: a 2- or 3-page resume with relevance and concurrency. As far as resume format - doesn't matter to us. could be Word, could be PDF\n\n3) **Recruiter does an initial discussion - called initial HR round** - if the resume gets picked up, our recruiter does an initial HR round. This is to filter the candidates, so that the overload does not come to the Tech Shortlist Team. They normally have a video conference (Team or Zoom). Nothing very specific here. Just make sure you impress the recruiter - dress well, groom well, have clear audio-video, emphasize that you are a perfect fit, if there is a self-assessment questionnaire, don't be \"too honest\". Example \"core ServiceNow experience\". If you don't have core expertise, but you know the basic, say that you are well versed. The Tech Panel will decide how deep they require that knowledge. No need to get rejected at this stage by being too honest. Try to rate yourself above 4 if they have a 5-point scale in all the tech questions. Remember they are 'Recruiters\", Not tech engineers. They are reading off a script to shortlist you. Some of the shortlisting questions I prepare and give to recruiters to score off. Also to note, if there are some facts that make you standout, it is good to mention here - example you have authored a book, no matter what book, good to mention, if you are a Google Scholar, mention that. What happens is that the Recruiters will make all such notes and these may be useful in Tech Shortlist. So any good points mention here\n\n  \n4) **Tech Shortlist** - **Assuming you cleared the HR shortlisting, then the resume come for a Tech shortlisting** - If your HR / Recruiter round went well, many candidates are elated. But it may get rejected here. The HR / Recruiter round, as I mentioned, is to reduce the overload on the Tech Shortlist. You HAVE to clear this particular this Tech shortlist before you get called for the Interview. This is the place where I enter. Or one of my colleagues enters. We are billable people working 8-10 hours with clients. We spend not more than 30 min.  (sometimes just 10 minutes) to clear the candidate. That is where all my point in item 2a come into play. So, if you resume is in alignment to points mentioned in 2a, I will definitely like it.  I or my colleagues just send a 1-line mail to the Recruiter \"approved\". That means, the Interview should happen. No specific points here, except that follow 2a guidelines. I have seen candidates coming to the interview as \"proxy candidates\" Meaning they are on video, but a friend is taking the Interview  DO NOT DO THIS. We have tools that detect this and it is an instant reject or a reject down the line\n\n5) **First Round Tech Interview** - by a Tech person, like me a Senior Consultant. Mostly 30 mins- max 1 hr. This is an independent assessment. We sometimes refer the notes from 2). But interviews like to do it their style. This is generally 30mins max to 1 hr. As stated, we all are billable people. We do 1 or max 2 of these kinds of interviews per day.   We are looking at the first 15-20 mins. That is your chance. Answer questions to the point. If you don't know something, here too, being honest is not a strategy, unless you have NO CLUE about the question. We all have targets to get the best out of the Interview. Everyone has their style. Some generic notes here - of course you should know the answers to these questions. Based on the type of the Interviewer, they could ask you simple concepts or core concepts. I personally, don't ask very basic concepts. I always assume that is the candidate has come this far, lets exploit for a \"possible select\". But I have had other colleagues who ask some basic questions. We have a \"template\" to fill after the Interview scoring the candidates. In our company, we go with the Job Description sequence and rattle off all the bullet points and questions related to the Job Description. Some Tech guys ask \"tell me something about yourself\". I don't ask those kinds of questions. I go straight to the Tech questions. But whatever you speak here, have a memorized script - especially any question related to the Job Description. Emphasize your work ex / skills related to any question. Be brief. Pause after 30 seconds - 1 minute after answering the question. The Interview may have a follow-up, or they may not have liked your answer. Pausing will give you time to recoup or move to the next question. I have several candidates ramble on and on, on a particular question, that was answered incorrectly. This distracts and derails your chances. Be confident, have a clear voice, dress well. Too well dressed is ok. Being in IT we do not reject anyone based on their dress or grooming at this stage. Your match to the Job Description, your resume, your answers are what determines your success. Also it is a good idea to view the profile of the person Interviewing you - LinkedIn, or other social media. If you have a common connection that resonates it works favorably. If you have highlights like: coming through a company referral mention here, if you have written a book mention here. Not too early in the Interview but midway or at the end probably, you  should highlight the non job part. At the end, the Interviewer may ask you - Do you have any questions?  Ask just one question. What you ask is not going matter in your eval. Just be courteous and ask 1 simple question - we are rushing to our billable job. We don't have time. So, stay brief. It is also ok if you want to ask an important question \"what is your assessment of my performance\", \"would you be able to connect with me on LinkedIn\". Sometimes the last question about LinkedIn helps, because they could give you a status update on your application. I have one colleague who works out of a remote city. That candidate created a sort of connection, having grown up in that city. It helped. So knowing the profile of the Interviewer may help, but not a guarantee. Note: sometimes the Tech Interviewer may be in Europe or offshore like India or we have a few from China. If it is their evening time, they are already tired, so take cognizance of the fact. We have 3 colleagues (peers) who take to load for this particular 50 open vacancies. So mostly it comes to us. One of them is scary. But if that person clears you, you may not even have the next round. That is the reputation of each of us. Even for me, if I clear a candidate in this round, the next round is easy, as I am known to be thorough. Just depends on who you are interviewing with.\n\n  \n**6) Final Round Tech Interview** -The Interviewer would most likely a peer or a person of higher level that 5).  If you have got selected for this round, means there are a few more validations to make. In my current company, if 5) clears you, this 6) is mostly a validation round. Unless of course you lad up with an absolute monster Developer or Architect. There is no specific tips for handling this. If you are able to get a feedback from the Interviewer in 5) above, this round helps better. If you are interviewing for Developer positions, there may be some online coding questions. Do everything that you did right in 5)\n\n**7) Final HR round** - intimation of your selection or keeping you as a \"warm\" candidate, pending some budget approvals / customer approvals, then offer letter etc. - I assume this is an area where most will know what to do. Also, at this point the target kicks in for the Organization, so they ensure that the process is standard and quick. Every offered candidate has to go through extensive 7 years BG Check (verifying employment, all the way upto verifying with the SSA records. Any discrepancy found, they may be terminated. And for specific projects, if the customer insists, we do a 7-panel drug test. **My notes on this point** - You have to be able to clear a BG Verification and a Drug Test.\n\nAs a final note - at our company we have \"recruitment metrics\" (sometimes they are called Demand Metrics). We as a Business Unit work as a team owing these metrics (from Recruiter to the final Tech Interviewer). We have to fill openings quickly or get pulled up by our leadership for slipped Metrics.  Our goal from finding a Resume to Final Selection is max 1 week from each Job Opening. I assume every company has these metrics. Keep applying and fine tune your approach again and again. Even if you have been laid off, even if you did not have a job for several months, there is definitely a success ahead. You will definitely get there. Jobs are there. We just need to FIND YOUR RESUME. ",

However, every interview is from someone contacting me about a different job by phone, email, or direct message. I generally get a few such \"direct contacts\" per week. I do get a ton of \"we're moving on with someone else\" emails, especially when applying on company-specific websites, so I know my applications aren't disappearing into a void. I worked with recruiters and resume coaches a few times over the years, so there's *probably* not anything wrong with the applications.\n\nI keep doing applications because I figure it bumps me to the top of some \"recently active\" filter recruiters use. Plus, there's always the off-chance an application actually goes somewhere.\n\nIs this normal, or am I just a statistical outlier?",

      "body": "Context first: I live in Pakistan and worked for a year at a Voip company as a NOC Engineer from 2022-2023. I left due to the grueling hours but other than that and low pay, the company was great. Fast forward to 2025 I haven't worked since, I focused on learning new skills and transitioning into devops but due to the job market here most if not all companies don't hire devops engineers unless they have at least 2 years experience. I got a little desperate and started applying for other positions. I landed a role as a trainee SE for a company that specializes in servicenow. The catch is that it was conveyed to me that for the first 2 months I would be trained in business development like bidding etc and after I would get a sense for the product then I can fully transition all the while in between company time I can do some self learning in servicnow as well but my project bidding came first. I thought it was reasonable since I'm a trainee and getting good financial incentives as well for each bid. Though after going for 2 days and researching servicenow, I realized it was not for me, I'm mainly aiming for aws etc.\n\nAll this was fine since I thought I should suck it up stay for the money until I found a proper devops role. But the final nail in the coffin for me was the company's questionable business model.\n\nThe process of bidding was as follows: \n\nThe company would hire a european/uk/US national of Pakistani origin and take ownership of his qualifications and CV and basically his identity. Our/my job was to apply for fully remote jobs in those regions as that european/uk/US national by impersonating him. Speaking to and emailing recruiters and companies for the job. We would give interviews ourselves and try to secure the job. Once done we would hand over that job to our inhouse employees and they would do the rest. The company would make good money and a piece would go to the foreign nationals as well for the duration of the project. The company would coordinate with the foreign nationals in case of SC/government/taxes/clearances and even make video calls with the hiring company to keep up the facade. There were approx 30-60 people working inhouse and the company would secure at least a gig a day approx (250-400 euro/day) pay rate. Because of the exchange rate earning in dollars is extremely lucrative.\n\nI was hesitant since leaving would leave me unemployed and since I'm a Pakistani foreign companies won't hire me with less experience and the tag Pakistani being attached. But ultimately I've resigned since my conscience won't let me work in dishonesty day in and day out. \n\nThis the reality here, I'm sure there are more companies that do this but I don't judge the employees that much since everyone needs to feed their family.

      "body": "I've done so many different things at where I'm working today that I seriously have no idea what job title I should look for when looking for job openings or how can I describe myself.\n\nI started working as an IT Governance Sr. Analyst, by:\n\n&gt; Conducting meetings and interviews with process owners in order to chart their existing processes, develop and chart new processes (incident and major for example), be the focal point for internal and external audits, define action plans/internal controls, chart and analyze risks in processes, help improve the Service Desk services, facilitate the communication between all the IT departments and the IT governance, help analyse all areas' KPIs, develop new KPIs and generate graphs from it, facilitate the communication between the company's customer service department and the IT department.\n\nThen I switched areas, they sent me to the IT Service Management area (in my contract I'm still a Sr. Gov. Analyst), and aside from all the things I was doing, I started doing new things, such as:\n\n&gt; IT provider management, contract management, project management (agile and standard/pmbok), analyze incident backlog, SLAs, major incident management (whenever a major happens, I'm the one managing all the communications and making sure every responsible person is in the call/room), help develop and keep improving a major incident room/war room, adquire new softwares/services, implement a new ITSM software (we were already using ServiceNow, but it was trash, so we put it to the ground and started all over again), develop an ITSM catalog, establish a governance over all the ServiceNow modules, coordinate a team of 1 analyst, 1 junior and 1 intern, establish a solid recurring meeting schedule to discuss incidents, changes, problems, major incidents, kpis, slas, backlog... all of that.\n\nThere's more, honestly, I'm not making things up here.\n\nAnd after all of that, I have no idea what's my job title/description. What kind of jobs I can look for... could you guys help me?\n\nThis may not be the correct sub for that, if that's the case, could you please point me to the correct one?\n\nThanks!",

Expect questions about your experience with Performance Analytics, reporting dashboards, data imports, and how you've handled data quality issues. The conversation will probably center around scenarios where you've had to troubleshoot data problems or optimize system performance.\n\nSince this is a 2+ year experience role, they'll dig into your technical depth but also want to see that you understand the business impact of your work. Be ready to discuss times when you've collaborated with different teams, managed data migrations, or implemented solutions that improved operational efficiency. The hiring manager will be assessing whether you can think strategically about data while still getting your hands dirty with the technical implementation. I'm on the team that built [AI for interview practice](http://interviews.chat), and it's particularly helpful for working on responses to these kinds of technical scenario questions where you need to structure your experience stories clearly and confidently.",

It helps you get comfortable with articulating your thoughts and experiences. Also, make sure to read through the job description carefully and prepare examples of how your skills align with the requirements.\n\nAs for ServiceNow specifically, it's a great tool, but Constellation Energy seems to be looking for more general IT service management skills in this role. Focus on highlighting your experience with project management, problem-solving, and communication. One thing that helped me when I was interviewing was using an AI tool that listens to interview questions and provides suggested responses - if you're interested, I can share it with you. Just remember to be yourself, and don't hesitate to ask questions during the interview.\n\nYou got this! It's okay to feel nervous, but try to relax and enjoy the conversation.
