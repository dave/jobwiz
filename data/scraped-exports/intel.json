We've got the brains (a team of 8 awesome engineers), but now we need **THE Hunters** – the sales rockstars who can connect our killer engineering consulting services with builders and contractors stateside. \n\nSince my own sales game is not that good, I'm turning to you guys for some intel:\n\n1. **What's the ballpark for a decent monthly salary for a sales agent in Lahore, Pakistan crushing it for the US market at night?** I'm curious about the *sweet spot* – what keeps them motivated? And what's the deal with commission? Is it a must-have for these go-getters?\n\n2.  **Now, for the real deal – the absolute sales *killers*. The folks who've probably sharpened their skills at places like Motive or Ibex. What kind of monthly loot are these legends expecting?** I'm willing to shell out **PKR 200k-300k ($1100)** a month if someone is truly a game-changer. Is that even in the right ballpark for Lahore's top sales talent? What kind of past wins would make that kind of investment a no-brainer?\n\n3.  **What makes a company irresistible to these high-flying sales pros?** Forget just the cash – what other cool perks, culture vibes, or growth opportunities really get their engines revving?\n\n4.  **How do I sniff out the real sales ninjas from the wannabes?** What kind of experience and skills should be screaming from their CVs and shining in their interviews? Any red flags I should watch out for like a hawk?\n\n5.  **Since our den is in Bahria Town Lahore, what's the secret sauce to attract and snag the best sales talent right here in our hood?**\n\nAny wisdom you can drop will be seriously appreciated. Help a brother out in building a sales dream team! 🙏",

If I bothered to look for advice earlier while I was a sophomore I would be in a way better position now but what’s done is done. To not repeat my mistake of not asking for advice I’m making this post. I’m looking for advice as an unemployed May 2023 grad wanting a career in data science and software engineering. \n\nA bit about me:\n* Graduated with a high gpa by brute force (hence why I didn’t apply to any internships/ I wanted to leave a good foundation for grad school apps eventually)\n* Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering\n* Math &amp; Physics minor\n* Completed 1 research project completely on my own from start to finish while a professor suggested what to Google - Collected a few million social media posts, did sentiment analysis using a pretrained model with zero fine tuning straight off of hugging face, then correlated averages to stock market and got cool results which didn’t really mean anything without proper statistical analysis\n* To do the solo project I paid for the google data analytics course off coursera to learn a bit and although not actually useful for that project it covered a lot of data analysis tools I used for my summer research\n* Did a summer research opportunity and failed catastrophically because it was virtual and had no deadlines and basically learned nothing practical. Learned a bit about neural network architecture\n* For my senior capstone project I contributed by reading signals off an arduino, made a GUI to have live signals converted into a labeled dataset, then with the help of a group member built and trained a CNN using the dataset, and finally enabled the CNN to analyze signals in real time and classify them to send a signal to another arduino. The whole project was getting emg signals off of someone’s upper arm and controlling a robotic hand at the other end of the system and I used MATLAB to do the entire data processing side.\n* I also worked for my school for two semesters. I was the TA for the analog circuits lab then for the VHDL on FPGAs class.\n\nFrom my 4 years I learned:\n\nLanguages: Python, MATLAB, R, Java, C++, VHDL, C, Assembly \n\nData: SQL, Tableau, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn\n\nWeb: HTML/CSS\n\nI’m trying to learn Git and I’m aware of AWS but job applications are what I’ve been spending most of my time on. I’m doing leetcode a few times a week but I’m burned out and just try to do it when I can. I’m also looking at making a website and doing some projects but I have little to no motivation. I have thought about grad school but it’s a financial burden on top of added stress for both me and my family.  I have reached out to family and friends and gone to my school career fair and nothing has come up yet. I’m still actively looking at non-tech companies and applying for those too and so far it’s also been silent or denial. My resume is decently formatted and I know this because it has passed through IBM and Intel ATS and actual recruiters in interviews have said, I like your formatting. I am still actively applying and have done around 80 applications so far. I plan to apply more and more daily and I’m gradually increasing my speed.\n\nSo, just like many other people I’m looking for an “entry-level” data scientist role anywhere in Georgia. I need to stay in the state for personal reasons. No success so far but I have hope. I can hold out for another 3 months before I grab a shift at best buy or apply to revature. I would probably go with Best Buy and do the OMSCS.\n\nWhat would you do?",

We're all here in one place, why don't we do something together?\n\nI don't know that much, unfortunately for me I don't know much web dev stuff  nor the myriad technologies listed on any given job posting, my experience is mostly in embedded systems and robotics, I think I'm pretty good though and frankly web dev and databases seem relatively easy when compared to robotics and real time systems and drones and computer vision and so on, I just haven't the time/interest to learn, nor the knowledge to know what to learn, but I think I am capable even if I do have a long way to go.

We might have to put in some time and organize and cross train each other, but we could get something together as a group.  That something might be a startup if we have some great idea and we make millions, but I'm really just thinking we create our own network, website, even just chat room, Hangouts, Google doc, whatever, to either just help each other get jobs, or cross train each other on high demand technologies, give intel on companies, contribute to open source with each other, think of projects to work on, work on stuff together, hell even give it our group a formal name that we can point to and list on a resume and give each other as references.\n\nThis sub is good because we have professionals here to give input, we need that to know what things are really like out there and to keep us going and encouraged, a lot of people in industry have given me a lot of needed encouragement, but for those of us not really going anywhere since finishing school, we have to help ourselves at the end of the day, and we're all in the same boat, so why not join together to do it?

Seems like there are a number of different ways to proceed, the main thing to start though I think is a place for us to all talk realtime, so the question is a subreddit, Slack, or Discord?

I can, but just because this was my post I don't want to try to claim ownership, however if there is no overwhelming consensus soon I will probably make a Slack channel and try to start a Discord server, and see how many people check them out and what people prefer.

      "body": "After seeing all of the H1b related posts I would like to share my own perspective on the H1b program.\n\nTo give all of you some background I have 9 YOE and was a project lead at a midsized company most recently. I have been a part of small startups and have worked at large companies like Microsoft and Intel and I have hired dozens of people, both citizens and visa workers.\n\nI want to start off by saying that H1b visas definitely have a place in tech, but there are some serious issues I am going to cover.\n\n* Astroturfing, Self Promotion, Toxic Culture, and Exclusion\n* Lack of Real Demand For H1b Visas\n\n**Astroturfing, Self Promotion, Toxic Culture, and Exclusion**\n\nI want to cover the astroturfing and Self-promotion first because this is one of the most infuriating aspects of the H1b issue.\n\nTypically anytime someone posts something regarding H1b visas it gets flooded with downvotes and lampooned with strawman and ad hominem attacks swiftly removing it from a subreddit. On top of this, it's difficult to engage in any sort of meaningful discussion when 90% of the comments are coming from H1b applicants who are calling you racist or throwing bullshit arguments around like \"it's good for consumers\" or \"its a free market\" as if they really care about that.\n\nThe self-promotion is a huge issue I have with H1b workers in general as well. If there is one thing H1b workers have mastered it is the art of self-promotion. Not only is it difficult to listen to people be so vain and cringe but it contributes to the toxic cultural direction tech is heading. H1b workers act as though they are so much smarter than everyone else and act like Americans are incapable of ever possibly doing the work that they do. It's incredibly arrogant and totally inaccurate. I think the thing that has bothered me the most working in tech is the general attitude people have that a programmer must be a high IQ genius on basically a genetic level. I have heard people say \"not everyone has the mental capacity for this type of work\" or \"a good developer would find it super easy to find a job right now\" or \"if you are actually talented the world would be your oyster\" which is total bullshit and 99% of the time it's coming from a visa worker.\n\nAnother aspect of the self-promotion that I would like to include is H1b worker's tendency to promote the hiring of additional H1b workers.\n\nI’m just going to straight-up say it, once you hire a handful of Indian H1b workers it won't be long until the entire department is Indian H1b workers. I have seen it happen numerous times at every mid-size/large company I have worked at (go walk through a handful of large/midsized tech companies and tell me the diversity of people looks normal at all of them). Most recently at the company I used to work at; within three and a half years of bringing H1b workers into the office they managed to push out every single non-Indian employee who wasn't an executive. There isn't a single Black, White, Middle Eastern, Eastern Asian, South American left working as a dev there.  My department was the highest-earning and the last one with Black, White, and Korean developers.  The other departments banded together and convinced the board to replace my team with half H1b workers (who could speak Hindi) and half fully outsourced. People try to cover it up, but from what I have seen Indian H1b workers are the most exclusionary group of people I have ever worked with who will fight tooth and nail to hire their own and push everyone else out.  I hate to be so blunt about it because not all Indians are like this, I had Indian friends growing up and still have some, but it seems that there is a sizable percentage who are guilty of the self-promotion and exclusion and the rest are largely apathetic to it all.  It's absolute bullshit that people cant call Indians out on this stuff when they are clearly discriminatory.\n\nH1b workers in general also bring a super toxic 'title/rank/status culture' into offices. Just going onto Linkedin it's easy to see how bad this issue has gotten. Every time I log in to Linkedin I see numerous posts with H1b students and Jr/Mid Lvl devs posting everything from exam scores and \"former incoming intern at company-x\" to mid-level devs low key college bashing and bragging about titles (as if these things really matter once you are a mid). It makes me sad seeing people cling to titles and use them to push other people down. This leads to an elitist office culture where everyone has to be an overachiever on paper. I can tell you that where someone went to college is not a strong indicator of how good of an employee they will make as I have successfully hired numerous productive developers.\n\nThe best developers have been the ones who truly love building stuff and have a non-competitive and casual attitude. I have interviewed and worked with many bad developers who went to top tier colleges and had 4,5,6 internships, it was not a reliable indicator. Matter of fact these people tended to be the least pleasant to work with as they had to constantly compare intellectual dick sizes and put others down for not being as elite as they were. Being a good developer isn’t even about being super book smart. It’s usually the resourceful self-taught developer who comes up with the simplest most elegant solutions, lazily simplifying a problem down to a daily chron job, meanwhile, the Carnegie Melon valedictorian will be trying to apply DP to find the lowest complexity solution that will run millions of times a day instead of once!  In the process of which they will write messy complex code that will then ‘require’ fellow elites to work on. I don’t have anything against Carnegie Mellon grads, I chose the school because I went there and I don’t put other people down for going to \"worse\" schools.  Not everyone comes from a background that sets them up to get into a top school and I haven’t seen any sort of pattern between candidates from top schools and high productivity. Most of the best developers I have worked with were self-taught. There really isn’t any lack of talent or need for ‘super-elite’ developers as many claim.\n\n**Lack of Real Demand For H1b Visas**\n\nH1b visas are horribly misrepresented and I truly believe they take away a significant number of Americans jobs each year. Visa workers often act as though they are entitled to have the chance to work in the US but Americans don’t have the option to work elsewhere, I can’t just decide to apply for a job in Switzerland, the odds of getting a visa are astronomically low for an American when compared to foreigners applying for H1bs. H1b workers like to act like acceptance rates are super low but they really arent, at the beginning of this year the approval rate was at 83.4%. The US brings in 85,000 a year, most of whom work in tech and can stay for 6 years.  On top of this, their spouses get H4 visas, many of whom end up working in tech effectively doubling the potential number of workers brought in to 170,000 per year. That’s roughly 1.2 million H1b/H-4 visa workers in the US at any given time when you factor in the 6 years. After which many get green cards and stay even longer making the actual figures larger.  The US Bureau of Labor estimates that there were 1,365,500 software development jobs in 2018. If you add all of the other computer and information technology occupations that arent support/help-desk jobs it ends up totaling to around 2.3 million jobs.  Granted not every single H1b and H-4 visa worker is working in tech but these visas still easily make up a third or more of the tech industry, which from what I have seen in person seems accurate.\n\nThere’s no way that this doesn’t have an impact on American workers, especially now with massive tech layoffs and an overall sluggish economy. No American tech worker in their right mind, especially college grads would be supporting this program the way it currently is. There is a surplus of talent and a lack of jobs at the moment. There is no need for 95% of the H1b visas at the moment.",

While OP blames the individuals that are working the jobs, a better explanation is the management of these companies.   Management has identified that H1Bs as a whole are about as productive as natives and will work longer hours, for cheaper and without complaint.   H1Bs take thankless prod support and O&amp;M tasks that would make other developers unhappy.  They are unable to job hop as easily, since it requires every new employer to go through the sponsorship process.   The H1B program is hugely problematic not because of the recipients but because it further shifts the balance of power between employer and employee towards the employers.  H1B gives employers critical leverage over their employees and the result is that wages are depressed for everyone.",

If you are a grad trying to break in, that may be true.  \n  \nBut for the rest of us, this generates an enormous amount of work.   The boutique consultancy / independent contractor space is booming, with work cleaning up after WITCH issues.   \n  \nThese non tech companies get themselves stuck.   \n  \n* IT management starts out with ex-techie types, and they don't have the right people skills.   \n* Business management gets fed up with IT being mean and communicating poorly, so they pressure IT to be run by MBA types.   \n* These new managers are more accountants and don't understand tech, so they get sold WITCH model.   Seems great, you can let contractors go at any time, they are slightly cheaper than employee total costs, etc.   \n* The high quality employees start leaving in frustration.   Good developers HATE working with very low quality coworkers, so move on.   \n* As management are not from tech background, it takes them years to realize the mess they created.   But if they admit the mistake, they may lose their job, so they start hiring boutique consultants to help cover it up.   \n* These boutique consultants are the old highly skilled developer employees, and now make MORE money than they ever used to.    They do all the actual work, but the WITCH consultants stay on to show success in the low cost outsourcing model.  \n  \nThe bodyshop H1b hustle has nothing to do with the genuine highly skilled H1b's employed at many tech firms.     To lump all h1b together makes no sense.  \n  \nWe should have a minimum wage for h1b that's double the median household US income.

It is not an engineering or a talent decision, it is a business decision. I've been in these conversations before.\n\nMBAs have done the math and H1Bs are actually cheaper long term because they have less flexibility to quit and move around. That is why American companies will hire foreign engineers. None of the tech companies are desperate for good talent, but Tim Cook will go on TV and say that anyway because a surplus of labor benefits the owner side and takes negotiating power away from the working side. The same surplus of labor also allows companies to make engineers jump through ridiculous hoops. It's the same reason tech companies say silly stuff like \"coding is a human right\". It benefits their bottom line. Also, do note that the H1B visa category is intended to be a temporary non-immigrant visa for extraordinary need (temporarily letting in more doctors during a pandemic is a great example of how the H1B was originally intended to be used), but are abused en-masse by companies who will employ foreigners long term and displace Americans.\n\nFrankly, I would be for getting rid of the program entirely. It's very rarely used how it was intended, and not at all in tech. When business interests talk about the economic benefit, it's a dishonest argument, because those economic benefits go to executives who run large corporations and not working class people.\n\nA country is more than it's GDP.\n\n&gt;On top of this, it's difficult to engage in any sort of meaningful discussion when 90% of the comments are coming from H1b applicants who are calling you racist or throwing bullshit arguments around like \"it's good for consumers\" or \"its a free market\" as if they really care about that.\n\nIronically, these are the people who are trying to downvote this thread.

      "body": "I just interviewed with the Intel Toronto and oh my god, their office sucks.\n\n---\n\n**My experience:**\n\nYou enter a cramped office building with a tiny lobby and short reception desk. You turn to the receptionist and ask for Intel's floor - \"Intel is floor 4.\" You take the elevator up and the doors open to a tall brown-tinted window. A hallway extends in both directions but quickly curves behind the elevator. Despite the sun still being up, barely any light makes it through the windows. You turn right and walk down the hallway but are blocked by a locked glass door. You turn around and walk the other way. A 25 year old employee walks by you and glances at you suspiciously. You look them in their eyes and smile, but their face remains emotionless. You reach the end of the hallway and are blocked by yet another locked glass door.\n\nYou look through door and see nothing but boring grey cubicles. You hear the dampened sound of office phones ringing. You press the button on the intercom by the door. Another phone starts to ring. And ring. A flustered looking receptionist opens the door. She's wearing a call-center headset and holding a phone in one hand. She looks *towards* you but not *at* you. \"Are you here for the interview?\" \"Yep, with ____.\" You follow her inside as she rushes back into her post-it-covered cubicle. You notice a little lobby. \"Should I just wait here?\" \"Yep.\"\n\nYou notice a strange smell in the office. It doesn't smell bad, just... unsettling, complacent, and old. You look around the office and see at least 50 cubicles, yet the office looks and sounds completely empty. You sit down on the lobby's couch and wait. An emotionless young man around 28 walks in and says hello. He leads you to a small office with 12 office chairs sitting around a table. 10 windows surround the room, but 9 of them have the blinds down.\n\n\"Alright, we're going to be doing a coding test. Do you prefer the whiteboard or a sheet of paper?\"  \n\"Can I use my laptop?\"  \n\"Uhh, nooo...\"  \n\"Alright, definitely a piece of paper then.\"  \n\nThroughout the entire 30-min interview, the interviewer doesn't smile even once.

      "body": "Hey Reddit, this is my first post, and unfortunately, it's a bit of a downer. I'm a recent CSE grad (2024) from an decent college, and let me tell you, placements haven't been kind to our batch this year. It's way worse than last year, with almost half of my classmates still unplaced.  \nLuckily, I managed to snag an off-campus internship at a Bangalore startup in December. The pay was decent at 60k per month, and honestly, I felt pretty fortunate to have something lined up. It was supposed to be a 3-month internship with a potential 3-month extension based on performance, possibly leading to a full-time offer.  \nThe interview process was intense (three rounds!), and I poured my heart into the work, determined to get that extension.  However, my company's laptop was a disaster - a slow, overheating old Intel Macbook that constantly crashed. Working on it was a nightmare. Once, I had a looming deadline, and the laptop wouldn't cooperate. Stuck without a monitor, I ended up pulling an all-nighter in the office just to meet that deadline.  \nTo make matters worse, my manager worked remotely during my initial internship months.  I worried he wouldn't see the effort I was putting in. Thankfully, my teammates advocated for me, and during a 1:1 meeting after two months, he acknowledged my good performance and extended the internship to 6 months. He couldn't guarantee a full-time offer right away, but promised a conversion if I maintained my performance.  \nEncouraged, I went above and beyond, grinding through weekends and late nights, tackling every task thrown my way.  Fast forward to 20 days before my internship ends, and I have a much-anticipated meeting with my manager.  He seemed cheerful, and I was honestly expecting an offer discussion.  Boy, was I wrong.  \nHe dropped the bombshell: the team didn't have an SDE1 position open, and hiring was frozen due to an upcoming SDE2 hire. Disappointed, he asked about my plans. I expressed my desire for a full-time.  He then offered to extend the internship (without conversion).  Honestly, that felt pointless. Internships don't count as real work experience, so why extend without an offer on the table? I politely declined.  \nHe asked me to document my work for HR.  I agreed, but deep down, I felt utterly crushed. Here I was, pouring my heart out, working late nights just the day before this meeting to meet their deadlines, and all I got was a dead-end extension offer. My manager didn't even offer any feedback on my work; instead, he asked for mine! (By the way, this entire meeting was over a call since he was still working remotely.)  \nNow, I'm venting here because I'm at a loss. All my friends have secured full-time positions, and here I am, jobless. Landing an SDE1 role seems much harder than getting an internship. Companies keep demanding 1-3 years of experience for entry-level positions, and getting interviews itself feels like a constant battle.  \nAny advice from the community on how to navigate this situation would be greatly appreciated. Feeling discouraged, but still hopeful! ",

Then I returned to Intel as an application developer intern for 6 months starting last summer. \n\nOne of my best friends has a nearly identical resume to mine (we went to the same high school, did the same extra-circulars, go to the same university now, we'll both be graduating this December with our BS degrees, we've worked at the same places including interning at Intel together). The only difference in our resumes really (other than format/style and personal info), is that he has been able to continuously work at Intel while I ended my internship at the end of summer/end of the year like most of the other interns but his group has a much higher need for the assistance and had a much higher budget. Yet despite all these similarities he's gotten interviews from just about every single company that he's applied to and I've applied to the same companies and many more and have only had interviews with two, one of which is coming up this week the other of which resulted in no offer.\n\nAt this point I just really don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I keep my LinkedIn profile up-to-date and very presentable. I have tried my best to highlight my strengths and experience when applying but I just haven't had any luck.

So feel the need to express my frustration with the whole process and see if there is anything I'm missing somebody might be able to point to.\n\nI graduated back in June of this year with a 4.0 GPA in a Post-baccalaureate CS program (I have a 2nd degree in Sociology that I ended up never fully utilizing). Regrettably, I didn't get any internships while in the 2-year program as I was working full-time for part of it already. I also didn't appreciate the importance of landing a \"recent graduate\" position prior to graduating. In my naive point of view, I figured I could take a final summer off to spend time with my family and start job hunting in the fall. On top of all that, I had a new baby on the way (a healthy girl born Nov 14th!) and I didn't want to get hired by a company and then be immediately on paternity leave.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy assumption: I am graduating with a 4.0 GPA, so landing some interviews when I start searching shouldn't be an issue and I'll be able to find the right position when the time is right.\n\nMy reality: Of the positions I've applied for (over a hundred so far), about half of them are immediate ghosts. For most of the rest, I get an auto-rejection letter days later. I've only actually landed three interviews so far, and one of them was after a career fair so I had an immediate leg up there, but it was in a niche I wasn't interested in. The other two didn't pan out (one of which was after 7 interviews as mentioned at the start...)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn an effort to figure out what the issue is, I drove two hours away to just have a 15-minute chat with an Intel recruiter to see if he can give me any guidance. His thoughts? My resume *looks great* and he has no idea why I'm not at least getting interviews. So no help there.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo now I'm in this weird limbo. I'm a recent graduate who missed the window for the new grad summer positions. I **might** be able to catch them next summer, but many of them are only accepting the most recent term graduates. So now I'm left with a degree, and a great GPA, but no career-related work experience (other than being a TA in the program) and no, or limited, opportunity to get into the programs specifically for people in my position.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHonestly just makes me want to break down and cry.

Yes, you should try to do what you can to stack the odds in your favor, but you're doing something that is hard and that has enormous carnival-game elements to it. Personally, the immediate post-college period was the worst time of my entire life because I just could not translate any of the things that are valuable about me to paper. It felt like if I had something to offer, *someone* should be giving me the time of day, and that was a really crushing experience. With the benefit of hindsight and a pretty successful career, I can look back *now* and say that those doubts were unfounded, but I sure as hell didn't know that then.\n\nYou might be dime-a-dozen in the sense that this is a very common experience, but that doesn't make the frustration and disappointment you're feeling any less painful.

I'm in Portland, but also considering moving to Seattle or SF because of better job opportunities (and I'd love to live in Seattle).\n\nMy question though is...where are the jobs, more specifically the lower level ones? I keep hearing it's a good market for CS, go into CS, and yet every time I've job hunted I've found it impossible to find much, and when I do every job is way too competitive because while I feel like I'm a pretty good programmer, I don't have a flashy resume and don't know really where to build it. People keep telling me \"Go do open source work\" and yet I feel lost trying to get involved there or even how that would stack up to resume padding anyway.\n\nFor the people who actually have managed to land jobs and aren't from a top-20 CS school with a 4.0 and some ridiculous credentials, how did you manage? I'm not looking to be chief engineer at Facebook or something here, I just want to make enough to pay my bills.",

      "title": "(Unpopular Opinion?) Where you went to school matters more than you think",
      "body": "**TL;DR: There's a 'summary' at the bottom, but it's still pretty long. A true TL;DR for those that aren't going to bother reading a wall of text is \"It can (and often does) matter a lot WHERE you went to school in terms of internship or pre-graduation work experience\". The views expressed here are 100% my personal opinion and are not intended to offend or marginalize anyone.**\n\nI'm going to preface this potentially unpopular opinion by saying that I generally agree with the common sentiment that the name of the school on your diploma is a much less significant factor in the CS world compared to other fields and arguably negligible for 99% of companies as early as a couple of years working in the industry. This is something I was told consistently by friends and family in the space ever since I first started expressing an interest in programming in high school and is a viewpoint that I haven't deviated much from even after completing my undergrad and spending over 5 years as a software engineer.\n\nHowever, spending several months on this subreddit has made me question a portion of this stance. **Namely, internships and networking during your college years.** I understand that there is an inherent level of selection/participation bias in only looking at posts made by users asking for help on a subreddit primarily geared towards answering questions and providing advice. Much like looking at any of the salary sharing threads may give a reader the false notion that the average CS-grad is working at a FAANG-tier company and easily passing 200k in TC by their mid-20s. That said, I couldn't help but notice a large amount of posts or even comments from a lot of current or former CS students with a common theme...difficulty getting responses, let alone interviews or offers, when searching for internships. I would see **dozens** of these posts/comments in a single day of browsing this subreddit. Comments about sending hundreds and hundreds of applications for internships and getting maybe a handful of responses were fairly common, and ones where the person didn't receive even a single actual response or interview were not uncommon.\n\nMy initial thought was there is potentially a significant gap between what I had previously accepted as 'typical' based on my peers in college and everyone else. For some context, I attended a public school (out of state student) that is relatively well known for their engineering and CS programs (won't list the name here, but it should be fairly obvious from my post history). This particular school's engineering programs had a strong focus on gaining work experience as a student and there was, at some level, an instilled culture where the average student had the goal of landing an internship/co-op or summer research as early as possible. I don't have any hard stats and wasn't able to find anything in a quick \\~10 minutes of google searches, but anecdotally, I don't think it's an exaggeration for me to say that &gt;50% of students in my major that ended up graduating had an internship or some major-relevant work experience by the time they were entering their Junior year, and well over 90% of these same students had **something** in terms of relevant work experience by the time they graduated. These percentages are obviously lower when looking at ALL students in the major, but I didn't feel like it was accurate to count students that either dropped out/switched majors or never graduated. While I recall sending out dozens, even hundreds, of internship applications as early as a few weeks into my fall semesters, I never experienced anything as close to as drastic as the stories I've seen here even when applying with little to no previous experience and a very minimal amount of side projects or 'portfolio'. Thinking back, I think a big part of this that I had previously took for granted was the wide availability of tools and opportunities I had through my university. We had one of the largest student run STEM-focused job fairs every fall with 400+ companies looking to hire interns and new grads. We had dozens of more specialized fairs throughout the year including a couple featuring only tech companies looking for summer interns. I even remember there being events specialized to the extent of '5 or 6 law firms looking specifically for CS or Engineering grads potentially interested in pursuing patent law'. In addition, the University itself provided an extensive career opportunities program that featured several prominent members of industry as well as a wide array of tools to facilitate internship and co-op applications. One of these widely-used tools I mentioned in past reddit comments was a portal akin to the 'common app' for students applying to colleges where a student meeting pretty minimal base criteria like being a Sophomore in CS or CompE and having above a 2.8 GPA could fill out some basic information and have their applications automatically sent to dozens of interested companies.\n\n I was rather average academically and certainly wasn't exceptional by any means in terms of having impressive side projects/apps. When I think back on my experiences applying for internships, I believe that the biggest factor was the fact that I was able to leverage all of these career fairs and provided networking tools in lieu of 'cold calling' companies or spamming my resume through a bunch of websites. When applying to larger well-known companies through school resources (Intel/AMD, Cisco, Microsoft, GE, large consulting firms, etc.), it was more or less expected you would at least receive a 10-15 minute phone call from a recruiter or even a short in-person interview/technical screening on site at the career center. Not getting a response at all was definitely not the norm in my experience. An immediate family member studied CS at another school matching the same profile (public school known for research ranked top 10 for CS and Engineering, solid reputation with industry) and he reported the exact same resources and events available to students there.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, I did some research into some smaller local schools (I live in Chicago) and also reached out to several HS and family friends that were either in the process of or had recently attained a degree from a school that would be categorized as an 'unknown' or 'not highly ranked' in terms of CS/Engineering/Tech reputation. This is where I really started seeing the difference in not only internship/work experience levels during college years but also the average attitudes of CS students at different universities. To put it slightly, the levels of career building and networking opportunities for students varied drastically by schools, with some schools not even having a dedicated job fair for internships, let alone one specifically for those pursing CS jobs. Granted, some of these schools had an undergraduate enrollment as small as \\~20% of the schools mentioned above and had proportionately smaller CS and engineering programs as well, but I was shocked to see how many of these schools completely lacked **any** sort of widely available resources for students pursing pre-degree industry experience. \n\nAnother takeaway was the difference in attitudes or underlying 'culture' in regards to gaining work experience as a student. While summer internships were a common focus and shared goal of a majority of students I went to school with, the same internships were viewed as considerably more rare and less ubiquitous as part of the undergrad experience at other schools. I spoke with a family friend that told me how almost no one even bothered applying for internships at his school because they were perceived as only applicable to 'geniuses that will go on to work for Google or NASA one day' or 'lucky kids related to someone working in the field'. This same friend mentioned how he and a few friends from classes had sent out applications as early in the year as October but witnessed a \\~95% rate of getting an automated 'Not what we're looking for at this time' email or ghosted entirely. Their applications were almost exclusively submitted via company portals or sites like LinkedIn/Indeed/Dice. It's worth noting that I wasn't just sampling 'no-name' schools... I also spoke with an old high school friend who recently graduated from a prestigious private school that was not known for engineering or tech but was still a name that 99% of people would associate as a top university. Even though he had an internship with a major tech company after his Junior year, he went right back to our hometown his first two summers to work the same exact job he had in high school helping run a seasonal boating rental company by the lake. When I asked him why he hadn't considered an internship prior to his junior year, he simply shrugged his shoulders and said that it never really crossed his mind and how almost no one in his classes the first two years had even discussed an internship as a possibility. He also mentioned that he estimated there were actually more undergrad CS students at this university that did summer research programs through the school or a partnered institution than those that had internships, but he also qualified the remark by saying it was a broad estimate.\n\nSo in **summary**, some of my initial views on the 'value' of where you went to school haven't changed. I don't believe there's a drastic difference in quality of curriculum between a well known program and the average program that may be ranked outside, say, the top 50 (especially at the undergrad level). I'm at my 3rd company as a full time software engineer and don't believe the name of the school on my resume had any noticeable impact on my current company's decision to eventually hire me. I also don't believe having access to a large alumni network in the tech space has translated into any tangible benefit since graduating and believe this is also the case for a majority of people in my situation. **However**, a vast majority of people I've met in this field that went the route of a \\~4 year undergraduate education in a CS-related field would agree that internships/co-ops/work experience is the most impactful part of one's 'resume' when entering the full time workforce out of college. Based on my personal experience as well as what I have witnessed from fellow alumni and friends/coworkers from similar universities, I would argue that it **does** matter where you went to school in terms of opportunities, resources and by extension, **capability** to attain work experience before graduation. This doesn't mean that I think someone who didn't go to a reputable, well-known CS school is incapable of getting a summer internship. Absolutely not! But the differences in resources and opportunities between several schools with arguably negligible differences in quality of coursework and instruction can be drastic, and it was quite eye-opening to hear friends tell me that summer internships for undergrad students were almost perceived as 'unicorn opportunities' while others like myself had the fortune to attend schools where almost everyone had some work experience prior to graduation. As I said earlier, I was a pretty average student, didn't have any remarkable project experience initially, and was/still am the furthest thing from a genius when it comes to nailing technical interviews. If I didn't happen to attend a school where the average sophomore or junior in CS visited a handful of internship fairs and other hiring events and had the ability to apply directly to well known tech companies through an exclusive, University-managed pipeline, would I have had the advantage of coming out of school with 3 internships under my belt and a huge advantage compared to the rest of the field when looking for my first full time job?\n\nI'm not posting this (unpopular) opinion piece to be controversial or to humble brag. If it wasn't clear in my long post, I attribute a lot of my experience or opportunities to the resources I was provided as well as the culture of my peers I was immersed in for 4 years of my life rather than my intelligence or work ethic. But I wanted to present this notion and get the thoughts of those on this sub. This is an opinion that I've only recently changed my mind on since I started browsing this subreddit around late last year, and I could be totally off or plain wrong on my assessment. Interested in hearing what other people think (specifically, current students or recent grads).\n\n**EDIT: In response to some common points I'm seeing in the answers so far...**\n\n* ***I did NOT attend an 'elite' university. People mentioning Harvard/Stanford/MIT/etc as a direct extension of my opinion are misinterpreting what I mean when I talk about the vast differences in internship searching and career building services between different schools. There are schools of similar 'reputability' with drastically different attitudes and resources for internships in the CS space. I cited a friend who graduated with a CS degree from an Ivy-tier private school that had very few offerings in this regard, so this isn't something that's exclusive to elite schools.***\n* ***To the several responses along the lines of \"Well, it only matters for your first job. After you get your first experience, it doesn't matter at all.\" - You're not wrong, but part of me feels like you're missing the point. Internships ARE the first experience for many CS grads, and my opinion is really just addressing the massive discrepancy in how assessable landing even ONE internship can be between different schools.***",

      "body": "I had one of the most bizarre interview experiences of my life today. (as the interviewer, not the interviewee) Thought I'd share. Mostly to get it off my chest.\n\nI'm the mobile development lead for a startup that most of you have heard of. We interviewed a candidate for an Android developer position we are currently looking to fulfill.\n\nGuy comes in with a strong background and resume. Seems like a nice guy. We start out with the usual pleasantries (Tell me about your background, where do you want to be in five years, whatever.) easy warm up questions with easy answers. Everything is swell.\n\nFor those who have never been on interviewer side of the table, it's tough. I have less than an hour to sum up this guys technical ability. To decide if he can provide meaningful contributions to our product or if he will just add more spaghetti and technical debt. \n\nOne method which I have found that works well is to ask open ended technical questions. Ask him about technologies he has listed on his resume. Try to turn it into an actual conversation. And if I am lucky he might even teach me something. So I ask questions like \"You have a lot of Java and JavaScript experience. Tell me some of the advantages of each language\". Or \"What are some challenges of developing for Android you don't find in other development environments?\"\n\nI try some of these question on this candidate. He doesn't like them and he makes that fact very obvious to me. He either gets really defensive  (\"I don't like that question. It makes me feel like you are looking for a specific answer and that's not fair.\") or he changes the subject. (\"I'm not sure. Let me tell you about this off subject thing instead.\")\n\nOkay fine. He's uncomfortable with the open ended questions. That's fair. I switch to \"trivia\" questions instead. Questions with an obvious right and wrong answer. (\"In Android, what does the AsyncTask class do?\") Personally I don't like the trivia questions. They don't tell me anything. All they tell me is if this guy has experience in an area. They don't tell me if he picks things up fast, or if he can write clean code, or anything that's really important. But it's the only thing he responds to.\n\nAnd for the most part he does pretty well with the trivia questions. In fact he did so well, and because a few impressive side comments he made, I think I am going to green light this guy to the hiring manager. But just to be sure I decide to give him a simple whiteboard coding question.\n\nThis is where things fall apart.\n\nWhiteboard questions suck. I get it. I've read the blog posts and agree with them. I've been asked them in interviews and have failed them miserably. But honestly, I have less than an hour to make a decision on this guy. Sometimes it's my only option.\n\nBut because of the fact I don't like them I try really hard to keep them simple, free of tricks and riddles and obscure algorithms. And honestly, even if this guy failed spectacularly I probably would have still green lighted him.\n\nThe question was to write a function that sums up all the integers in a nested array. Anyone with a passing familiarity with recursion usually can get it within 15 minutes. And if they don't I will gladly give them hints and help until they do. And if they can't get it at all, I often overlook it. I literally failed FizzBuzz in my first ever interview because I was so nervous. I get it. \n\nHe gets up to the whiteboard, makes a few marks to get his thoughts together, and then suddenly turns around angry. Demands to know if we ever need to write code like that in Android, and demands to know how to solve a recursion problem matters.  I say yes, sometimes we need to use recursion in Android programming. He starts insulting the company. Yelling about how any company that focuses on \"pressure programming\" isn't a good culture fit and not somewhere he would ever want to work. He is visibly upset. I honestly thought he was going to punch a hole in the wall or break something. He was that upset. He storms out of the room, saying we don't know what we are doing and that he would never want to work here and that we need to learn more about modern programming culture.\n\nWe dodged a bullet in my opinion, guy obviously has some behavior issues. But wow. I sat there in stunned silence for a good ten minutes before I walked out.\n\nThe funny thing is if he has just said he was uncomfortable with the question or didn't know how to do it he probably would have gotten the job. I really did like him up until that point.\n\nTLDR; if you are in an interview and don't feel comfortable with a whiteboard question, just politely decline or say you don't know, you might still get the job. \n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "Going to be a long post, will put a TLDR at the end, but want to be able to explain all my thoughts here and give a full backstory.\n\nI've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. My mother was a web developer, had her own server at home, and would push me to learn and research about computers myself to be able to gain that skill.\n\nThe first interest I had was when our Windows XP computer would no longer boot. Turned out to be because the drive was out of space, so I booted into a live Linux CD and wiped some files off the drive. Years later, I got into Minecraft and was introduced to Java, made a mod, and quickly decided I didn't want to ever do programming again. I was 12 years old at the time. I tried a computer science class in high school, decided I didn't like it either. \n\nI was really good at troubleshooting issues and fixing computers, screen replacements on iPhones, basic IT stuff. I ran multiple Minecraft servers and got very used to JSON and YAML formatting, being able to understand documentation of plugins and being able to configure them properly. I was able to set up VMs and have a whole network of servers running for Minecraft manged in Linux and that's when I got introduced to infrastructure side of things. \n\nI never knew what path to go into college for this stuff, was thinking hardware engineering since I wasn't ever good at programming, but later actually went into college for criminal justice, as I thought I wouldn't be able to succeed in a tech job without good math/programming skills. I was working at a pizza place for a bit, had way too hard of a work ethic for minimum wage, and was taking an IT class as an elective for college. \n\nOne of the assignments was to look on indeed and write about one of the job postings, and how we felt about it. I found a local job that contracted with Apple, they send their trade-in devices to them, we fix them, resell, and the cycle continues. I applied as a mobile repair technician, aced the interview, and was called backed with an offer the same day. I worked the pizza place and this for a bit, but started off as a mobile device auditor. I was freshly 18, management saw my work ethic and said that I was one of the best auditors they had seen - I was able to research problems with devices that they would usually need to reach out to Apple for an apparently this was a skill they just hadn't seen before. I was able to go through devices quickly and they moved me to the quality assurance team.\n\nI was at that team for a few months, then they had begun a government contract to recycle/resell all of their e-waste. This included devices no one in the building had never seen, servers, switches, lots of IT specific stuff and generally unknown things. I was asked to run this department by myself, researching, auditing, repairing, and getting a basic value of the systems that came in. Up until this point I was a contracted worker, but then was offered a full-time position with the company, but was still getitng paid only $1 above minimum wage (which is pretty hard to survive on in California).\n\nTwo more people joined the government team and I trained them on what to do. Things I did included recovering Cisco switches via serial connection (government has their own software on them), repairing HPE/Dell servers, making documentation on proper e-waste disposal of the systems (they sent them to us with no GPU, RAM, CMOS connecters ripped from solder points, since they thought they held valuable information) soldering in new CMOS connectors on motherboards, they even trained me on the forklift to manage getting the pallets out of the racks and much more that I can't even remember. I was quickly realizing that the work I was doing was a lot for the amount I was getting paid.\n\nOne of my managers had told me that 3 of our employees quit and jumped ship to Intel for the better wages as contract workers. I looked on Indeed, found a position and applied. I got past the two interviews and was accepted for the position. I started off as a level 2 lab technician which included deploying pre-production hardware in server racks, building server racks for these machines, recovering them when they went down, and dealing with tickets assigned by Intel engineers. About 2 months into the job, one of the technicians got promoted to an Intel engineer after he got his computer science degree. He was a level 4 and the position was opened up and they wanted an internal hire to take the spot. My manager encouraged me to apply even though I was new, so I did. The interview consisted of two parts, the first was building a \"PreSi\" (pre-silicon) server from scratch and deploying it to the testing software. All we had to go off of was an outdated internal wiki page and our ability to research questions.\n\nI was able to build the server and deploy it, I got a little help with some networking issues due to IT restrictions, but other than that was able to get it all done. We were timed during the setup and that was used as part of the promotion decision. The second part of the interview was an in-person quiz, asking us questions that we are allowed to google and use the wiki for. I plugged my laptop into the projector so that they could see my thought process. I got stumped on a few, but got the majority of the answers correct.\n\nThe next day I was brought into a meeting to go over the results, and my manager quickly told me that I got the position. I was surprised, as the other people who had applied had been working there for 3+ years, but my manager told me my research skills really made me shine. He said after the interview, him and the other person were so shocked they were just silent for a bit and the first words out of one of their mouths was \"what the fuck was that\" since they were surprised I did so well having just started.\n\nHaving this new position, my old position was now open and my manager had asked me for any recommendations. My brother was new to computers but I knew he was a quick learner so I got him a job too. He ended up starting as an infrastrcture techinican, which will come into play later in the story. \n\nAs a level 4 technicnan my main responsibilities was deploying PreSi servers and getting the more advanced tickets from Intel enginerring. This was a very tedious process, which included imaging a server with a USB, running a shell script, rebooting, then running various commands and registering/configuring the server on our internal software. The whole process from first poweron-active testing was about 1.5 hours. My manager had encouraged me to learn a little bit of Python, as our internal software has a REST API with Swagger documentation and a lot of the tedious tasks were part of that software. He also told me that I should switch my degree to computer science, as that will open my opportunities to much more job opportunties. I was hesitant, but decided this was a good idea. The next semester I was going to swap to computer science and start the major-specific classes like java programming and assembly. \n\nAt this time my brother had also been working in the Infrasturcture department (still only 2 desks away from me though) and was introduced to Ansible. One of the engineers told him that it would be a good idea to look into automating PreSi, as it had never been done and woud be quite the time saver. My brother approached me with the idea and at this point I had a little bit of Python experience (nothing more than editing pre-made scripts) and thought it might be a good idea. I wanted to make it as easy for our technicans to be able to use, so I thought of making a web-based program (like all our other internal software) and using a UI to run Python/Ansible scripts that would automate this process. I was talking about it with my brother and a level 2 technician overheard what we were talking about and asking if I could automate the pre-production deployment as it was also tedious web UI tasks that were repetive and time consuming. It also included adding our systems to NetBox and tracking them there, with a lot of settings on NetBox matching our internal software. After looking into the API documentation I saw it could be done and added it as an objective.\n\nIt took about 9 months, but after countless hours of research and reading documentation I was able to create a program that automated most of our common tasks, PreSi, and pre-production deployment. It used Python and Ansible for PreSi, then just Python for the other tasks. The PreSi deployment went to poweron-test ready in 30 minutes (which was only restricted by a job that had to be run on the server that took 25 minutes), pre-production deployment times were cut drastically, and our other common tasks were cut too. My brother and I presented our program to Intel mangement, they loved it, were very impressed and approved it for use. I got a $40 bonus for it, and my contract company manager was very apologictic saying that that's the best they could do, a little salty about that but it's okay I learned a lot from it. I'd also like to point out, this program was made just in our free time when we weren't busy from other tasks, and management didn't have any idea we were making it. I managed all of the Python, and my brother created the base Ansible for the PreSi imaging.\n\nIt has been in use for about a year now, unforunately haven't been tracking metrics on it (need to implement a tracking function but haven't had the time) but with the logs I have in place it has been used on 300+ systems since deployment. Back in January, I was transferred to the Infrastructure team as my brother told them I was getting bored of my job (I was, I felt I had learned everything I could for the tasks we were doing) and they were able to open a position for me. During my time in Infrastructure I managed live production Ansible inventories, created playbooks, edited playbooks, researched how to upgrade our extremely outdated systems, and got familiar with a lot of Ansible functions and basic infrastucture needs.\n\nI watched a Zabbix dashboard, when we got a high severity alert I would be the first person to investigate. I was also expected to create Jira tickets and track what I was doing to make sure management could keep track aswell. Also dabbled in a little K8s, kubernetes, grafana, DRDB, mysql, gluster, and more I can't remember right now. Every day was a learning experience and nothing was repetivie like the lab technician position was. I was no longer bored with my job and genuinely enjoyed learning and being able to figure out all the issues that were thrown at me. I was the go-to API guy, figured out automating HPE iLO/iLO amplifier and creating github workflows to automate metrics collections.\n\nUnfortunately, our lab suffered layoffs 2 weeks ago for the first time in 6 years. They got rid of 3 contract workers in our lab (of 7) and luckily my brother and I were spared. I was however taken off of the infrastructure team and put back into the lab team (deploying pre-pro hardware and PreSi). I'm hopeful that once I get a computer science degree (2.5ish years out) I will be able to move up to an Intel enginerring position with the impressions I've made with our management. I want to wait it out, but the problem is I feel that I am going to get bored pretty quickly like I did before in this position and want to be able to make a living, or at least some money, doing what I like.\n\nI want to do side work, freelance, but I don't even know where to begin. I figure that if I can be at home doing somthing I like, I can wait it out at Intel doing something I don't like until I get a degree and (hopefully) get an engineering position. Since I'm currently a contract worker and I made that program in my free time without ask, that code is able to be publicly uploaded to Github according to my manager, given that I remove all company/internal software branding. I haven't had the time to go through all the code and edit that out, and I also don't know if it's even worth it since I don't know where to upload it to show my skills and get offers.\n\nI'm looking for any advice from you guys on any freelance work I can do with my skills, or anything I could work on to try to improve my portfolio and make money with my skills. Going back to setting up server racks, moving servers, deploying pre-production hardware, when I have all these other skills just feels like a waste to to me. I know I'm capable of so much but just don't know where to look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTDLR:\n\nCurrently working as a contract worker for a company, in my free time without ask created a Flask program that automated server deployment and pre-production hardware deployment with Python via REST APIs and Ansible, moved to the infrastructure department and got a taste of how fun it all is, moved back to my old department as a deployment technican and am lost on what to do with my skills. Don't want to get a whole different job since I feel I have quite the chance of becomming an eingeer once I get my compsci degree, but want to do freelance work but don't even know where to beging.

It should be standard. Lack of it may not be a red flag, but their response to your inquiry for it tells a lot.\n\nFirst post, had to share because it’s so despicable.\n\nApplied to a non-profit that works to gain universal health access to everyone. Hiring coordinator set up an interview, which I thanked them for. Upon reviewing the job description again, noticed no salary info or benefits listed. Asked for intel. Coordinator replies with an acceptable salary figure and states no current benefits (ironic already) but that’s expected to change soon.\n\nI say I understand and ask for some clarification on flexible working hours or PTO as it applies to proper work life balance, especially now with the pandemic and all. I also ask about their idea hiring timeline and what to expect during the interview process so I can be prepared.\n\nCoordinator reaches out and says the team has decided I’m not a good fit for the kind of work that this role entails. Not true, given my depth of years of experience in the field, including multiple years in a similar at another non-profit.\n\nTranslated: “Since you care about normal things like PTO and a healthy work life balance, we simply think this isn’t a good fit! We need a mindless cog who will work without benefits or asking any questions.”\n\nBullet dodged obviously, but really shows the true colors of some of these companies and organizations that claim to be for “all people” are specifically the worst internally with their practices and approach. Gross, but also exhausting to be interviewing nonstop for over a year and only seemingly acquiring more horror stories firsthand about the job process with no end in sight.\n\nReminder: YOU are interviewing them and assessing them to see if they are a good fit for you.\n\nThis sub has helped me tremendously with so much, and despite all the bullshit, I’m somehow still persevering.

They came back with, “salary DOE and no benefits at this time.” The job was legitimately to help others access affordable healthcare (I’d have been doing QA), so I, like you, felt it disgustingly ironic that they didn’t offer benefits to full time employees. I interviewed. They asked me what I expected to be paid, and I told them my expected base pay plus $x to cover health insurance. They told me the base pay was acceptable but my health insurance was my responsibility.\nI was floored, and asked how they could justify offering no benefits and refusing to compensate employees enough to be able to afford insurance when their company mission was to provide the same to others. They ended the interview (which I fully expected and would have done myself, otherwise). Lmao.\n\nI just spent a year applying to nearly 1,000 jobs before finally being made an offer, last week. A few months in (and after the experience above), I stopped applying to jobs that didn’t include compensation ranges/a benefits overview in the posting.

Whether I talked to a company or had a good conversation or whatever seemed to be completely uncorrelated to getting an interview.\n\nThat being said, they really do take your resume and write stuff down about you, and put it in a pile. They typically put all the resumes in the same pile, and those are looked at much more carefully than if you were to just generically apply online, so it might be worth it even to just get your resume in the pile.\n\nFor smaller companies, I've heard from friends that if you research about the company beforehand, and talk to them about what they do (rather than having them explain it to you), they often get pretty excited and it almost guarantees an interview.\n\nObviously, all the general soft-skill advice applies (be personable, smile, make sure you don't have sweaty palms, give a firm handshake, EYE CONTACT, good posture, etc.).

So I signed up to see if there is any information but its just basic info, nothing about insurance or anything.\n\nSo I now I am not sure if this a scam or not. What do you guys think?",

He said I'm way above the level that he's looking for.\n\nIt's a warehouse job paus $17. We had a really great conversation. He felt I was better off at Intel or doing a a coordinator role.\n\n2nd interview on Friday. I went to a warehouse that recycles computers and other stuff. My previous employer used to be their client but not anymore.\n\nI got a tour of the place. Manager loved my questions at the end. He said I was a maybe to be hired. Smh...\n\nGreat conversation. That was it. My assignment at this temp agency, the season has ended. I was doing data entry for their client chase, data entry for the IRS. Next month, it's gonna be dead or very little work with very little hours.\n\nI got an email from my staffing agency and onsite supervisor if we wanted to stay on assignment for Sept peak to let them know. Smh I decided to stay on just in case.\n\nI don't know where else to apply too. Let me be clear: I've been to the workforce development sites in the past. They don't help, same jobs that I can find on indeed.com, and they give out of date resume advice. So does goodwill career centers. No, I don't go to job fairs anymore. Why? They're gonna tell you to go online.\n\nNobody does in person dropping off resumes anymore. I'm not wasting gas to do all that shit. That's disrupting the manager's  work. I've been asking people that I know about if their companies are hiring. So far no but I can check the company website \n\nI've been applying to remote work as well. Everyday those companies turn me down. Right now, I'm working on design software so I can launch my etsy shop.\n\nI don't care about being overqualified I just wanna work. I don't wanna be a manager, I don't wanna do IT (I have a degree in network administration) anymore. I'm at the stage of wanting to work for myself. \n\nI'll still take a job anyway while building this business. My hubby and I are still wanting to move out of state by next year, shit we can't accomplish that cuz we are still looking for work. He's 49 facing age discrimination. Everybody in this market is basically overqualified 🙄\n\nI live in a big city and the jobs are still crap. To find at least decent pay, you gotta travel for 1.5 hours for it. Nope. \n\nDegree or no degree the pay here is crap. I've even applied to retail, fast food, etc nope I still got rejected",

However, the interviewer got back to me several days after she said she would and informed me that they decided to go with someone else. The whole experience left a bad tase in my mouth. They told me they would make me an offer and decided not to, it seems to me, clearly based on my responses to questions about my race and gender. And it's not like I said anything abrasive, I just gave a standard PC milquetoast response that I imagine most people in my position would give.

Once again I am in the job market and it is so tough to deal with applications, recruiters and interviews. Outside of being an Industrial Engineer, I'm getting my PMP cert, I know SQL, Power BI and Excel, but somehow it feels impossible to get a job.

I've been frantically searching for a job for the past few months so I immediately got into talks with this recruiter. They already had my resume and asked me to write a cover letter, which I did and submitted it to them. The following day they emailed me telling me that my resume has been shortlisted and they will send me information regarding an interview by next week. The following week I reached out to them for any updates regarding the interview. They told me that the long weekend put them delayed some things but I should be receiving the information soon. The following day I received an invite to a Microsoft Teams meeting for this coming Monday for an interview and a meeting this Friday (2 days ago as of the time posting) for an interview strategy meeting. In the meeting I talked with a couple people from Pyramid Consulting and they gave me advice on what might be in the interview and I should leverage based on my resume and cover letter.\n\nSo far everything seemed reasonable and legit but when I did a bit of deeper research some things started not to add up. When I checked the Intel website, this job was not on their, and neither was it on LinkedIn or Indeed. When I googled the job title, I found an exact copy-paste for the job for a different company called Superbeo (which upon deeper inspection might be a vendor for Intel? I don't know if that information is relevant). After seeing this, I did decided to look into Pyramid Consulting to see if they are even real. Reviews from various sites about Pyramid Consulting are very mixed. Some people say they should not be trusted while others say they are legit. Looking at the meeting itself, the person who they said is supposed to be interviewing me from Intel (who is a real Intel employee as far as I can tell), isn't in the meeting. Although there is someone named Intel-PCI-Delivery from Pyramid Consulting in there so I'm not sure if they're connecting using that email. Finally, the last thing to set off some alarm bells within me occurred at the end of the strategy meeting. After discussing interview strats, they asked me to show a photo ID to confirm that I was the person that was supposed to be interviewed. I ended up showed them my drivers license without really thinking about it then continued to discuss some other things.\n\nSo now I'm stressed and confused. The supposive interview is on Monday and I have been practicing for it, but the possibility that this job offer is a scam is rattling my brain. I'm no stranger to job scams, but this one feels so well put together that I can't tell if it's a scam or legit.",

I want to have ideas about what I can manage to negotiate based on your experience, knowledge, (and) pay if you are willing to share. \n\nPart of why I feel uneasy is because I got paid more than this when I worked in the military (intel) and that I recently completed my undergrad studies with the highest honor, summa cum laude. Considering that, I feel as if a $40,000 base pay is low. What do you think is the right approach? I mean, I can walk away from this position but I wanted to hear others' insights and thoughts.",

      "body": "After reading a post yesterday about a recruiter dealing with a difficult client, it got me thinking that I should do a quick write-up about how to spot a worthwhile recruiting agency.\n\nI'll preface this by noting that most staffing agencies are littered with untalented, undevoted agents who'll burn out of the industry in a short few years.  The field has a low barrier to entry, offers mostly commission-based sales jobs, and will hire just about anyone.  So, it's no surprise that you will deal with your fair share of crummy recruiters when working with a staffing agency.\n\nLet's get down to brass tacks.  Here are some characteristics of a quality recruiter and staffing agency.\n\n**Good recruiters have relationships with their clients**   \n\nYou ever get the feeling that your recruiter is willing to throw anything at the wall hoping that something will stick?  If so, you're working with a low quality recruiter.  A good recruiter has relationships with their clients.  They have connections in industry with whom they talk to regularly, go out to lunches with, and know on a more personal level.  When recruiting candidates for their clients' jobs, it is rarely a mystery to them what they are looking for.  This is because they have an actual relationship with that client and not just throwing random candidates at random job reqs.    \n\n**Good recruiters know what the hiring manager is looking for**\n\nIf your recruiter seems to be playing a guessing game about what the hiring manager is looking for, then they are a low quality recruiter.  As mentioned before, good recruiters have relationships with their clients.  As such, they know precisely what makes a good candidate for a specific job that is being hired for.  If they aren't talking to you about specific things you should list on your resume or things you should talk about in an interview, then they are shooting in the dark and hoping something will work out.\n\n**Good recruiters prep candidates prior to interviews**\n\nIf your recruiter isn't setting up time to go through questions and talk to you about the hiring manager's preferences before an interview, then you're working with a low quality recruiter.  Before every step in the interview process, a good recruiter sets up time with candidates to give them intel on the interview, the hiring manager, and anyone else you may be engaging with.  This is because a good recruiter wants to make sure you are set up success so that you can land the job and they can get their commission.  \n\n**Good recruiters stay in touch**\n\nEver work with a recruiter on one job req and then never hear from them again?  Then you're working with a low quality recruiter.  At the core of any good recruiting philosophy is relationship building.  If they are not building relationships with their clients or their candidates, their priorities are out of order.  They are likely playing the volume game, hoping that if they throw enough at the wall, something will stick.  This creates neither a good experience for the client or the candidate.   \n\n---\n\nHope this helps you look out for important traits in a good recruiter.  If you're working with a recruiter and they're not demonstrating the aforementioned qualities, it's probably time to bounce.  Good luck out there!",

It was an hour long and the first part right out the gate was a hardware test but they told me it’s just to see how I would handle it and how I much I would know. They gave me a broken down intel nuc to piece back together and they said that depending how far I got it would add to my results and they threw in a curveball for extra points if I got it right. They said they used to give people 15 minutes to complete it and now they only give 8 minutes. They stepped out of the room and gave the 8 minutes and I actually almost assembled everything, I need to clip on a white and black wire and I would have finished assembling it. They came and said “wow you actually got further than most people, some people don’t even attempt it.” Then we moved on to about 12 unique questions. They asked if I knew what Active Directory is and I’ve personally never used it before and I was honest about it and then they asked the “how would you explain what RAM is to a 5 year old, in way they would understand” I kinda froze there and I tried to explain it but I had a hard time. They said “no worries it’s not an easy question so we can skip it” I didn’t want to skip it but we did. After that though everything else seemed good and I even worked with a really good a very well know support specialist there at the same company and I told them that he shadowed me and they seemed impressed. I dumbed the interview down a bit on here but essentially would any of you think I did bad? Or did I do decent? I’m pretty nervous that I did kinda bad and granted I get nervous and anxious easily.",

      "title": "Some insights as a hiring manager",
      "body": "Hi all, I've seen a few posts here from people expressing confusion and frustration with the recruitment process, so I wanted to share my recent experience from the other side as a hiring manager. Every firm will be different but thought I'd share some perspective on how haphazard the process can be on the corporation's side in case it's interesting. Sorry for any clunky phrasing i wrote this on mobile.\n\nAs context, I work at a large multinational company in Strategy, and I was hiring a Strategy Manager and Strategy Consultant.\n\nFirst of all, the jobs were posted on the corporate website about three days before it went out to LinkedIn and other career forums. At the same time, the brief went to two recruitment agencies who the company already had ties with. The way this company works is a hiring manager is allocated an HR partner to support the process. After the job was posted, I didn't hear anything from my HR partner for a week, in the meantime I got regular calls from the recruitment agents looking to get more detail about my hiring needs and also put forward candidates they already had connections with.\n\nBy the start of the next week I had two interviews lined up via the recruitment agents. On the Monday of that week, my HR partner emails me to say there had been around \\~200 applicants and she attached the CV of around 40 applicants she had already shortlisted. She asks me in the email who I would like to interview. I'll note here that she didn't even forward me the cover letters.\n\nDue to the 40 attachments I had to get through, and being pretty busy in the day, I didn't have time to spend long on any single CV and did this after hours. Going a batch of CVs, it's easy to rule out 90% of people almost immediately. They clearly have no idea what they're applying for and it's not easy for me to see the connection between their career history/ambitions and this role. I would've loved to carefully interpret how their career is aligned, but there were at least 3 CVs where the connection was so clear that it was a no-brainer to progress them for interview. Personally, I was surprised this company's HR didn't put more effort into screening, but I take sympathy on their HR department because she was severely time poor.\n\nI want to note here that I personally didn't care at all if a candidate had jumped around in their career, had taken travel breaks or were currently unemployed. It did not matter if they ticked other boxes. However I do care if they are overexperienced (e.g have 20 years experience for a job where 5 years was called out) or if they don't currently live in the country and don't explain their goal (honestly it takes one sentence to give context, then it's not an issue otherwise it feels you just sent your application in on a whim).\n\nSo a few interviews were set up, and at the same time the recruitment agents would call me almost daily with new candidates. Those candidates got a much higher quality introduction because the recruiter would explain their strengths. Well, one recruiter would do this. The other recruiter sent me completely misaligned candidates. The recruiter would also follow up within about 20 minutes after an interview to ask for feedback as well as telling me what the candidate thought of the interview, which is useful.\n\nAfter a week I had had a few interviews and was feeling good about two candidates. I can let you know it's somewhat of a nightmare going through recruitment. People think it's being a hardcore bo$$ but in reality it's hard to line up your colleagues' and boss's time when it comes to subsequent rounds. You're taking a risk if your boss interviews a candidates and they hate them. Plus candidates change their mind all the time (fair enough) but you might have 2 quality candidates then they both pull out because their current workplace gave them a better offer, or they change their mind, then you're back at square one. For this reason, it's important to keep interviewing candidates, so honestly if you've ever been invited to an interview you always stand a chance even if you're the back up because someone else declined (happens quite often!). \n\nAnother observation is that in my line of work people rarely are the full package. I had three key things I was looking for, and most people only ticked two of the boxes. So if you feel you have some shortcomings in a role, it may not matter depending on the position and the role.   \n\nIn the 2nd or 3rd week, I hadn't heard back from HR partner when I asked her to send me more CVs. Finally I chased her down and she sent an additional batch of CVs and the process repeated. If there's a takeaway there, it was a case of first in best dressed (for this company at least)\n\nAnother piece of intel is that the company was going through a tough end of year period, and requested for any hiring managers to delay start dates by at least 4 weeks because on mass that saves a lot of money. \n\nAgain, every company's process is different. There's more insight when it comes to the subsequent tests, references, negotiations but wanted to share some perspective on applications/recruitment in a large company in case it's helpful or interesting :)",

You'd get training on all the different plans State Farm offers so you can explain the options well. There's probably paperwork involved too like filling out applications. As for what to expect, I'd imagine a lot of it would be customer service - answering questions over the phone, setting up meetings to discuss coverage in person, that kind of thing. There may also be sales goals you have to meet each month. It could be a lot of independence too since you'll be the one managing your clients and portfolio. I can see why your mom might be skeptical since it is commissions based, but if you're a good communicator I bet you could do well! At least go to the interview and see what the job is really like - you might surprise yourself.

Your resume which was posted online (CAREERBUILDER) has been reviewed and approved by our recruiting team and has been forwarded to the HR desk of Intel Corporation, and we are very pleased with your listed qualifications and would like to conduct an on-line interview to discuss the duties within the job, along with the pay scale for the following Remote Opening Positions: (HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A RUN-ON SENTENCE LIKE THIS ONE!?)\n\nPositions: Logistics and Management, Payroll Clerk, Administrative Clerk, Customer Service and Data Entry\n\nThe pay is $32-$45/hour, training and orientation is $20 per hour.\n\nThe company will be providing you with all the necessary working materials needed for the job (Full time or part time) are you still interested in the remote job positions?\n\n(First of all I keep track of every position I apply for and I never applied to Intel Corp. Secondly they will string you along in a Teams interview never able to turn on their camera, or email you directly from their Intel email account and cannot speak to you over the phone.\n\nIn the end they will entice you with a high paying position, inform you that you will be meeting with your local company contact. BUT, in order to get ALL THE NECESSARY WORKING MATERIALS NEEDED FOR THE JOB, you will need to fill out the W2 Forms, Sign the Offer of Employment Letter and PROVIDE YOUR BANK ACCOUNT ROUTING NUMBER AND ACCOUNT NUMBER and YOUR LOGIN AND PASSWORD so that they can keep track of how you are spending the money they send you.\n\nIT'S ALL A SCAM. IF IT’S TOO GOOD TO BELIEVE…DON’T BELIEVE IT! I was seconds away from scanning all my completed and signed forms to them and then thought, WHY WOULD THEY REALLY NEED MY LOGIN and PASSWORD. There has never been an employer in my employment history that has ever asked for this kind of information. THEY DON’T WANT TO TRACK HOW YOU ARE SPENDING THE MONEY, they say they will be depositing to your account for laptops, printers, etc. THEY WILL BE EMPTYING YOUR ACCOUNT.",

      "body": "I used to treat interviews like pop quizzes—winging it and hoping for the best. Spoiler: It didn’t work. But after switching up my strategy with some out-of-the-box prep, I finally cracked the code and got an offer I’m psyched about. Here’s what made the difference.  \n\n--- \n1. Build a “Cheat Sheet”  \n   - Jot down 3-5 mini-stories about your wins (think projects, problems solved, teamwork). Keep it short, like 30 seconds each. Glance at it before the interview to jog your memory—no waffling required.  \n\n2. Decode Their Questions  \n   - Listen for what they’re really asking. “Tell me about a challenge” isn’t just a story prompt—it’s “prove you’re resilient.” Tell me about your teamwork skills“ is actually “are you able to work in our Team that has diverse people and be able to excel in group activities” Answer the hidden question, and you’ll stand out.  \n\n3. Practice Out Loud \n   - Talking to yourself in your head isn’t enough. Call up a friend and run through your answers with them—it’s free and forces you to articulate. Or try an AI interview tool like InterYue. I used it for quick voice practice and feedback when my friends were busy. Either way, you’ll smooth out the stumbles.  \n\n4. Flip the Script with Questions  \n   - Ask, “What does success look like in this role 6 months from now?” It shows you’re thinking long-term and gives you intel to tailor your answers. Plus, it’s not the usual “What’s the culture like?” yawn-fest.  \n\n5. Warm Up Your Voice  \n   - Before the interview, read something aloud for 5 minutes (article, book, whatever). It wakes up your vocal cords so you don’t sound like a robot or croak through “Hi, I’m [name].” Trust me, I’ve been there.  \n\n6. Stay Loose: Sip water, shake out your hands—anything to ditch the nerves. You’re chatting, not defending a thesis.  \n\n7. End Strong: Recap one thing you’re excited about from the convo in your “thanks for the time” bit. It sticks in their mind.  \n",

Research Salaries Before You Interview**  \n- Know the market range for the role *before* your first interview.  \n- Use tools like Glassdoor, Payscale, or LinkedIn Salary Insights.  \n\n### **2. Mine for Intel During Interviews**  \n- Ask bold questions like:  \n  *“What’s the budget for this role?”*  \n  *“What does success look like in this position?”*  \n- Use their answers to negotiate smarter later.  \n\n### **3. Communicate Your Value Unequivocally**  \n- Highlight your unique skills and achievements—be specific.  \n- Example: *“I increased sales by 30% in my last role by [specific action].”*  \n\n### **4. Don’t Disclose Your Current Salary**  \n- It’s irrelevant and can weaken your negotiating power.  \n- Politely deflect: *“I’d prefer to focus on the value I can bring to this role.”*  \n\n### **5. Avoid Being the First to Mention a Salary Figure**  \n- Let them make the first offer. Use it as your starting point to negotiate up.  \n\n### **6. Stay in the Driver’s Seat**  \n- Guide the conversation positively.  \n- Example: *“Based on my research and experience, I believe [range] is fair.”*  \n\n### **7. Read Between the Lines**  \n- Understand what their offer says about how they value you.  \n- If it’s low, ask: *“Can you help me understand how this number was determined?”*  \n\n### **8. Understand That Salary is Only One Part**  \n- Consider benefits, perks, and professional growth opportunities.  \n- Example: *“If the salary is firm, can we discuss additional vacation days or a signing bonus?”*  \n\n### **9. What if Their Number is No Good?**  \n- Stay calm and open. Ask questions to gauge flexibility.  \n- Example: *“Is there room to adjust this offer based on my experience and the market rate?”*  \n\n### **10. No Deal is Better Than a Bad Deal**  \n- If the offer doesn’t meet your worth, keep searching.  \n- Example: *“I appreciate the offer, but it doesn’t align with my expectations. Let’s stay in touch.”*  \n\n### **Final Thought:**  \nNegotiating isn’t about being greedy—it’s about knowing your value and advocating for it.

      "title": "Salary negotiations when a salary range was posted in the job listing. (LONG)",
      "body": "There have been a lot of questions about salary negotiations on Reddit lately. So I thought I would offer up some advice and insights that I have accumulated and taught. My background : I have hired thousands of employees for companies like Apple and Intel internationally, I have worked in Human Resources for the State of California, and I have partnered with organizations like Hiring our Heroes to help veterans and military spouses find well-paying work as well as the Junior League (multiple locations) and Grace Hopper to provide interview, negotiating and leadership seminars. My experience has been for companies who are based in the US, but include international hiring. I can not speak to negotiations or salaries for non US countries. There are always exceptions, but if you keep these things in mind it should help you put together your case for more money as well as avoid some disappointment. (I am not semi-retired owning my own small business)\n\n**In general,** when a company has a salary range listed on a job posting (For this exercise we will use $75k-$100k). You should expect that they do not have the budget for $100k, and they start a majority of their new hires closer to the $75k. They expect that if you will not take a job whose pay is within that range, you will not apply. In general, they expect the average salary of all the folks to start a little below the midpoint of a salary range. So if it says $75-100, they are looking at $85 on average to start.\n\nLet's say this job’s qualifications say:\n\nRequired:\n\n1-3 years experience in x;    1-3 years experience in y;    Bachelor’s degrees in these couple of majors\n\nPreferred\n\n5+ years experience in x;    5+ years experience in y;    Master’s degree in these couple areas\n\nWhen looking at the qualifications (Preferred and required). If you only have 1 year of experience in both and the Bachelor’s degree, and you have some other intangible qualifications that were on their list, you should still only expect an offer of $75k. If you sit solidly in the Required bucket, above minimum, but may not have additional intangibles you should still expect an offer of $75. Top end of required, $80. Some required and some preferred: $90k, all preferred $95. If you exceed all the preferred, you will be offered, or can negotiate to get the $100k. To negotiate for sign-on bonus, sign-on stock options, or a salary above the range, you should exceed all the preferred and have additional skills or experience that can be helpful to the role that you are also bringing to the table. \n\nDuring the salary conversation, do not bring up why you need the money, only talk facts and figures. Here is how I meet and exceed the qualifications, here is what the market salary is for this role, and here is how I can be an asset to the team. Then state what you are asking for. This is the conversation that should be had when they call and say they would like to make you a verbal offer for $80k. After you accept, they put in all the paperwork for final signatures to provide the written offer, and it can be too late by that point. If the gap you ask for is too large, they may pull the offer out of fear you will quit for a higher-paying job as soon as you find one.\n\nSome companies (And most government jobs) have 0 negotiation options. Most that post ranges, can only negotiate within that pay range. Stock options and bonuses are sometimes easier to get, as they will be a one-time addition versus play into your payout for the length of your career. Additionally, stock options are vested only after you have been with the company for several years, so it removes some of the company's risk, while still providing for your future savings. \n\nSide note, if a company does not have the salary range listed, I highly suggest an attempt at negotiating if it is not what you were expecting or hoping. They often lowball offers.\n\nYou may be wondering why it has to be so difficult. Large corporations do this for the protection of both the company and the employees as it can reduce some of the bias that comes in when deciding on pay. With many of those corporations, every position is assigned to a code. For example, they may have NT1-8, ET1-8, &amp; MG1-8. When a position is budgeted it is assigned to one of those codes and the codes have strict pay ranges. So let's say this position is an ET3, and that has a salary range of $75-100. In order to pay someone above $100, they have to go back and say that role is now an ET4 with a pay range of $85-115 and provide justification beyond just 1 hire as to why the work now meets the requirement of an ET4. Additionally, everyone else in that role would have to also be moved to ET4. Those types of approvals take a long time and are really hard to get.\n\nAlso note, that for companies that have those types of pay structures, once you reach the top of your salary range, there is an expectation that you would work towards a promotion for any further pay increases. At that point, your salary may stop going up with annual reviews, but would likely be supplemented instead with bonus or stock options.",

      "body": "Company A:   \n\nWorking with the company’s hiring recruiter— \nInterviewed with them twice this past week (virtual and in person). They extended an offer Friday that was at the 10th percentile of the salary range posted, go figure. They said I interviewed well, have the experience, exactly the candidate they were looking for and would be an asset to their company.  \n\nI got some intel from an employee that they have been looking to fill this role since Q1 after an employee resigned. They clearly want to move fast in filling this position.  The responsibilities would involve managing a book of business, as well as, manage a young team of professionals. \n\nThe salary they offered doesn’t even cover the AE responsibility in managing a book of business let alone having four to five direct reports. Some of which graduated from college less than three years ago (oh and two interns).  I’d have to ask for $100K MORE for me to even consider, but here’s the thing…\n\nThe company is run well. Lots of room for growth within the organization. The president is very personable, smart and cares about their employees. Clearly stressed with the double workload they have in their hands since their employee left in Q1 (culture/personality difference). They need to hire someone who can hit the ground running and they’ve expressed they are confident I can do that a number of times. I did find out there are no other “real” candidates at the moment. \n\nThey did ask that I’d bring them a decision by Tuesday, but I did share with them I may need some more time. Did not share with them I was interviewing elsewhere, because they didn’t ask. \n\nCompany B:\n\nWorking with outside recruiter —\nInterviewed with this this company in person on Friday and it went well.  Well enough for my recruiter to call me a couple of hours later informing me they want to meet for one last interview (virtual) Monday morning. So no offer here…yet. \n\nNow this company was a bit less specific when answering some of the questions I had.  I’m going to ask the same questions again and see if I can get more information to help me get an idea of the workload.  \n\nThey have a real need to fill this role and have already shared they want to have someone on bored before the end of July.  My recruiter found out that there is at least two other candidates, one of which is one of his.  My recruiter did mention to me that both of the other candidates are a much older than I am (I’m in my mid-30s - 10+ yrs in this industry), so they certainly have more experience.  The one thing I picked up on was that their staff was younger and they were looking to fit in someone that can quickly relate and help mentor. \n\nUnlike Company A, this company did ask if I was interviewing and I was transparent. This could be another reason why they were quick to ask for a final interview.  I’d expect (maybe ask them for) a decision before the end of the week. \n\nQuestions: \n\nDo I wait to tell Company A that I was also interviewing with another company?  Basically banking that I’ll get an offer from Company B? \n\nOr send them an email first thing Monday morning before my meeting letting them know I’m going to a final interview with another company? \n\nAny other suggestions/tips on how to manage this would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If yes then you can try to negotiate for something that's 20-30% higher or just take it. Regardless accept the offer if your current job is somewhere you are leaving regardless.\n\nThen if Company B comes with an offer you like and decide to work there, you renege/quit on Company A and move on. If Company B doesn't give you an offer then its back to the drawing board and hope you find something better.\n\nDon't mention you're still interviewing to Company A at all. The mention of competing interviews/offers are only valuable before a company gives you an offer or you are at the negotiating table (asking for 100k more is not at the table sadly). \n\nTechnically if you wanted to you could tell Company B you have an offer to speed up their process but thats not advised in the current market and depends on how willing you are to accept them ending process with you.

      "body": "Video: [https://youtu.be/dlbfZJmY8t8](https://youtu.be/dlbfZJmY8t8)\n\nPutting the transcript here so you don't need to watch if you don't want to, I want everyone to adopt a better end-of-interview-questions habit:\n\nMost candidates are sabotaging their job interviews at the very end when they're given an opportunity to ask the interviewer questions and they ask really bad or really generic questions and you're probably asking those bad or generic questions too. I'm going to teach you how to fix it. Let's get into it.\n\nImagine having a great job interview, maybe even an average job interview. You're at the end of that conversation where the interviewer has been controlling the agenda, has been deciding what you're talking about, and they finally give you an opportunity and they say, what questions do you have for me?\n\nAnd you finally get to set the agenda. You get to decide what to talk about. You get to focus it on your candidacy, your interest, your curiosity, but 99 percent of folks don't take that opportunity. They ask something that everybody else asks that isn't that exciting to respond to that doesn't actually get them any Intel about the company or the role.\n\nAnd again, there's the opportunity costs of asking great interview questions. That's what we're going to talk about today, where you could have sealed the deal as being a competitive candidate and a must hire. We're going to go over what exactly asking great questions will get you, and it'll get you job offers, why generic questions are so bad, a three step framework for asking great interview questions, a bunch of real world examples, and a couple of nuances to round things out.\n\nSo first, let me clarify, the end of an interview is the opportunity to end on a high note, to end with energy and excitement about your candidacy and the particulars of you in that potential role. But instead, most people ask a generic question or two that they got off of a blog, and they shuffle away, and so does the interviewer, and it feels low energy, when in reality, there's a great opportunity to use that moment to really solidify, again, the particulars of your candidacy, or your passion for the company, or your understanding of the industry.\n\nI'm going to give you a three part framework, but first, let me help you imagine what sort of reward you're going to get by using it. Imagine giving the company and the interviewer the feeling that you already work there. Through the specific questions that I'm going to help you construct, you will feel like an insider already.\n\nYou'll feel like you're on their side of the table talking about things that they only talk about with their teammates. That insider feeling is going to give them the impression that you're going to have a great start in the first 30, 60, 90 days of your new role. Imagine, too, that you bring up such a unique conversation through your questions that it actually gets them really excited and engaged to the point where they go over on time.\n\nAnd as long as you're still talking about the company or the job, that's often a great sign. If they're going to spend more than their dedicated time with you in that interview, it means they're really engaged by your curiosity. They want to share more facts and more details about what's going on inside the business.\n\nAnd you're going to gain more intel than other candidates are getting because those other candidates are cut off at time. And every once in a while, you're going to teach the interviewer something new, usually accidentally through the methods. We're going to talk about in a moment, you're going to bring up a competitor they haven't heard about yet, or talk about a product strategy.\n\nThey haven't given a lot of thought to this. Isn't super common, but it's more common than you think. And what a great way to delight your interviewer. You're going to teach them something new. That's going to make them better at their job or seem impressive to their teammates. That's fantastic. So that's going to be effect of asking great interview questions.\n\nBut let me also first clarify what's the effect of asking the generic questions that everyone always asks that everyone always tells everybody else to ask, here's where they go wrong. Generic questions, put interviewers on autopilot. They've answered it a thousand times before. They have a script in their brain.\n\nThey're not going to be engaged. Even as a founder and CEO of a startup that I spent the past five years passionately working on where I care about the mission of the company. I'm put on autopilot when people ask me about the vision of for agency, my startup. Because I have answered that question so many times and I do feel an obligation to every interviewee that asks me that question So I'm going to give them some version of a scripted response that goes off in my head But again, I'm gonna be on autopilot.\n\nI'm not going to be excited about it It's not gonna have me leaning in and Most people ask the same questions as everybody else because everyone looks at the same set of advice or ask the same seemingly clever questions You got to break out of the mold Also, the rehearsed response is usually not going to give you any insider Intel, the vision of the company.\n\nYou can see online success in a role. We're going to talk about this later too, can only be so many things. This rehearsed response that you're getting isn't just something that they commonly say. It's something that's usually pretty boring. And these questions don't set you apart. You're usually asking something about the company.\n\nThat's pretty vague and pretty broadly applicable. And so they're not putting you in the spotlight. Again, you control the agenda for the first time in that conversation, take advantage. And I'm going to be pretty dismissive here, but let's be honest about the generic questions that people are advised to ask.\n\nWhat does success look like in this role? I don't know. How about doing a good job? What will the first 30, 60, 90 days look like? I don't know. The first 30 days, learn about the company. The next 30 days, learn about your job. The next 30 days, do your job. Well, what's the company culture and work life balance.\n\nDo a good job. Don't be a jerk. They'll say that by the way, even if they have jerks, you're not going to gain actual insider Intel. If you have genuine questions about this, you're usually gonna have to infer it based on what you're seeing about the company, either through interviews or through what you read online.\n\nWhat are the opportunities for growth? At any place, if you do well enough, you will grow in your role. What are the biggest challenges for the company? I don't know, doing more? Making more money? Do you have any hesitations about my candidacy? Do not ask this question! Why? Why? Why do people think this is so clever?\n\nIt's not. You're going to get me to think about the negative components of your candidacy and you're going to imagine that you can respond well enough in that moment to make that lasting impression that we walk out of that room or that Zoom with that being the last thing that was thought about and talked about.\n\nI know people ask this question, and get jobs. That does not mean this question is what got them the job. I know that there are interviewers that have said they've liked when this question is asked of them, and that's why they hired somebody. We don't know why we do things. This question, on average, will not do you well.\n\nThe existence of anecdotes to the contrary should not give you the false impression that this is a generally good practice. Anyway, the whole point is, you know the answers to these questions. If you don't, email me, I'll give you the answers to these questions. They're the same, they're boring, they're gonna put the interview on autopilot.\n\nAnd they don't put your candidacy in the front seat. Okay. We've been talking about what not to do. Let's talk about what to do. It's a three step framework. We're going to demonstrate knowledge. We're going to ask the nuance and we're going to live in the edge. When you get into so much detail about each of these steps, but let me first give you an overview.\n\nWe're going to demonstrate knowledge. We're going to showcase a nuanced understanding of the company, the industry, the role, the market, the team. We're then going to use that demonstrated knowledge, which I'm going to refer to as the DK later in this video, we're going to use that demonstrated knowledge to ask a nuanced question.\n\nWe're going to use that knowledge to ask a specific question that requires a thoughtful response. And when that succeeds, we're going to be in a unique conversation. In other words. Probably no other candidate has asked this question, or at least in this form, and you're going to be getting a unique and novel response.\n\nYou're now in a one of one conversation, so you should stay in it, follow up a little bit, engage them on the conversation, have a volley back and forth about this new topic, because again, this is a one of one conversation that no other candidate is having. That's super valuable. As an example here, I'm going to put two questions on the screen that a candidate might ask in a job interview, and I want you to tell me which one you think is more impressive.\n\nYou won't even need to know what the company does. I'll get to that in a sec. The first one is what's the vision of the company over the next five years? Tuts I'll sign that this is a bad question. It could be asked of any company and of anybody. Second question. I noticed ramp and Brex are diverging with Brex now offering cash management while ramp focuses on expense and SAS.\n\nHow do you see these paths evolving over the next few years? Again, we'll get into what these companies do because I want to go through this example, but they're basically asking the same fundamental question, but you can tell that one is so much more specific, so much easier to respond to so much more interesting to respond to for an interviewer who works at the company ramp.\n\nThere's a demonstration of knowledge about these two companies and how they're different infused in the question and asking of the nuance about the vision and the road map in light of this competition, and it's likely to cause the person to have an emotional, positively emotional, competitive response that's going to put you in a really unique and exciting conversation for them.\n\nBecause again, you're gonna feel like you're on their team. Let that sink in. We're going to dig into the framework in more detail here. But just to dive into this question a little bit more, RAMP is a fintech startup. They provide corporate cards, they provide bill payment, accounting, expense and spend management software.\n\nBrex is one of their main competitors that offers many of the same features. But the knowledge that we're demonstrating here is Brex, first of all, being a main competitor of RAMP. But also we're demonstrating the knowledge that we're aware of how Brex differentiated itself a few years ago, which is they went for cash management.\n\nIn other words, treasure your banking for startups, so holding their cash and money, whereas ramp stayed as software that sits on top of other banks. So you can't store your money with ramp, but you can still do your accounting, your cash management, your corporate cards with Brex. You can do both. And the nuance question, the thing we asked is what's the vision in light of this product choice that Brex made in light of the way ramp has not gone into cash management.\n\nAnd again, the person is likely to respond viscerally again in a positive way, right? They're going to justify the divergence why ramp has made the choice they have or what the theory might be in the road map moving forward. They might forecast to you how this competition is going to continue to change over the next year or two based on the inside until they have.\n\nThey're going to appreciate that you're already aware of these nuances, even though you don't work at this company and you probably aren't the one at the company you last worked at that actually had to make this choice and that most candidates probably are not aware of this dynamic. Okay, with that first example out of the way, we're gonna get to more later on, but let's dive into each step of the framework.\n\nWhen we're demonstrating knowledge, what we're doing is we're finding out what is unobvious. And this doesn't need to be that crazy, but it's basically saying to the interviewer, Hey, we've already done the base level homework or a little bit more than the base level homework to understand a lot about the company and the industry, the product strategy.\n\nAnd so I'm not going to ask you something generic. I'm not going to put that homework on you to describe to me what I should already know. I'm bringing some of that knowledge to the table already. This might be about competitors. This might be a market positioning. This might be about pricing strategy.\n\nBut again, this knowledge is a pattern that you're identifying that other people probably aren't. This might be you identifying that you've actually dealt with a similar challenge at your prior company. This might be you noticing that there's a lot of hiring going on in a particular department and.\n\nAsking a nuanced question based on that. Maybe you're talking about a specific launch and the nuances of a product launch, or you're referring to past conversations in the interview. But again, you can also look at pricing pages. You can look at product pages. You can look at documentation. You can look at reviews on Reddit.\n\nThere's a lot of places to gain Intel as to what exactly a product's doing, why it's doing it and bring that conversation to the table. And again, you're telling that person, I'm not putting the homework on you to answer the question in this generic and broad way, I'm bringing some of the table stakes so we can have a deeper conversation.\n\nOkay, and then we're going to ask the nuance. Here we're inviting the person to rant or ramble. They're not going to have yes or no responses. Instead, they're going to have something to respond to. Because the DK, the demonstrated knowledge that you brought up, and the way you've asked the nuance question using that DK, allows them to really give you a depthful answer, beyond the norm, something really advanced, compared to other interviewees.\n\nAnd the way you can ask a nuanced question is like, what does the demonstrated knowledge make complicated? In other words, based on this demonstrated knowledge that we're bringing up, what's the implication to the product to the team to my role? How might the demonstrated knowledge complicate something about the company?\n\nAnd by the way, pro tip, rather than just asking, you can also posit how it might change things. So in other words, you might say, Hey, I think this means the roadmap is going to change in XYZ way. Am I right? Correct me if I'm wrong. By positing, you're again demonstrating, I'm willing to do some of the thinking.\n\nYou don't have to do all of it in front of me. I have something to bring to the table, but I also am aware that I might be wrong, so feel free to edit me. It's a great way to, again, invite a more complicated and interesting conversation. The great thing about demonstrated knowledge, too, is we can complicate a generic question with it.\n\nSo don't be afraid if you're wondering, Okay, how do I f find all of the structure of questions that I could potentially ask, you'll use the pattern you're identifying, and then you can go back to some of the generic questions that you often have asked in the past, or people suggest to ask and make them more interesting, like we did with that vision question in the beginning.\n\nAnd by the way, if you have the opportunity, you can sometimes link all of this to your past experience so that it leads down a funnel of you being able to talk about why you're going to be well suited to solve a problem beyond a team, basically, it allows you to put your candidacy in the front seat. So again, this might sound like you saying from the outside looking in some X, Y, Z demonstrated knowledge seems interesting.\n\nCan you tell me how that affects my team or unlike your competitor, you seem to have chosen this road map path. I'm assuming that means X, Y, Z, but correct me if I'm wrong. You're using the demonstrated knowledge and using what that demonstrated knowledge implies to ask a complicated question. Again, we're gonna go through more examples in a sec.\n\nBy the way, before we move on, if you're finding this valuable. Hit the subscribe button. There are more resources in the YouTube description if you're in a job search or will be in the next six months. Leave a comment if you've got questions. I want to support you in reaching the height of your ambition.\n\nAnd then again, we're going to live in the edge. That's the last part of the framework. If it's a successful asking of a nuanced question, you now exist in a conversation that no other candidate will likely have. Stay in a little bit. Volley back and forth. Reciprocate with their enthusiasm, with their rant, with their word vomit.\n\nAsk follow up questions, tie it back to your role, because again, you are now in a deeper conversation than 99 percent of candidates are going to have. Okay, let's go through three real world examples of how you might use this framework. Let's say that we're interviewing at the company Webflow. If you don't know about Webflow, it's a website builder, a WYSIWYG.\n\nAnd what you're going to do is you're going to do your research. We'll talk about this in a future video, so subscribe if you haven't already. But you're going to do research on the company, you're going to find out a couple different things. The first, which you might already be aware of, is its biggest competitor of the, you know, shiny object at the top of the hill of its ambition is going to be WordPress.\n\nWordPress is the biggest back end content management system for the web. Webflow is more modern, but it's a newer startup. It's just gaining market share as of the last few years, and it's competing against the behemoth that is WordPress. And so when you do your research and you gain that understanding of a pattern, you're gonna understand that they care about WordPress as a competitor internally and probably think of it as the company they want to be in the future.\n\nWhat you're also going to find is there's a pretty prominent competitor that's emerging called Framer that a lot of people are considering instead of Webflow nowadays. In doing deeper research, you're going to find that Framer is getting a lot of folks because it is simpler to use, it is designed first, so it's getting a lot of folks who like to design nice landing pages, which in the modern era of tech and the web is more important than it's been in a while.\n\nAnd it seems to be nipping at the heels of Webflow. And going to my earlier point, a lot of people interviewing at Webflow won't be familiar with Framer. It's still relatively small. Even some people at Webflow probably don't know about Framer. But most people at Webflow, especially if you're interviewing for a product position, engineering, marketing.\n\nAgain, if you're in the flow of the competition that this company is going to have with the rest of its market, they definitely know about Framer. And so when we bring this up as part of our question, they're going to think of you as already being an insider. And understanding the nuance of this competition is going to be really interesting.\n\nSo again, you're gonna find out all this stuff because this is a demonstrated knowledge that you're building up. So now that we've done that research, let's think exactly what the formula question could be. We're gonna demonstrate that we're aware of Framer as an emerging competitor. We're super aware of WordPress as the thing at the top of the mountain.\n\nWe hopefully also understand the nuance of why Framer matters and how it's actually nipping at the heels of Webflow. So now let's complicate the vision question. We're gonna ask About the vision in light of this competition with WordPress and Framer, and we're going to pause it rather than just asking the question, we're going to offer a suggestion as to what we think this means about the world and allow the interviewer to edit us and likely the edge that we get to live in is they're going to think, well, you know about Framer, they're going to reveal how they think about Framer internally, how the roadmaps are different.\n\nThe product value propositions are different. They might even say on another competitor that you didn't mention a Shopify because Webflow happens to be building a lot of e commerce features lately. So again, you're going to be in an advanced conversation. It's fantastic. And so the final form of a question you might ask, and it might sound different than this, but a structured version of the question you might ask.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but it feels like framer is starting to gain steam amongst small customers and designers. But WordPress is still the bigger fish. Curious what the internal vision is on the bigger competitive focus. This is the version of the question where you're just asking about the internal state and vision.\n\nBut again, the positive version of this, you might end by saying it feels like WordPress is still a bigger target because while Framer is gaining steam amongst designers and startups, bigger companies are evolving into Webflow. The features are more advanced. WordPress is the competitor to care about from a roadmap perspective.\n\nAm I right? Correct me if I'm wrong. And that's a version where again, you're going to offer a view of the world based on your research. And that's going to give them a little bit of ability to respond more directly to you because you're positing something that's easier to respond to than simply asking the question.\n\nAnd it doesn't matter if you're slightly wrong, don't be like categorically or philosophically wrong. But again, if you're slightly wrong and that's actually okay, they don't expect you to know the company or the competition better than they do. Okay, next example. Let's say they interviewing at the startup air table.\n\nIf you don't know it, it's basically Google sheets on a lot of different steroids and during your research, you're going to look at the careers page, not for the job you're interviewing for, but you're going to notice there's a ton of solutions, consulting roles that have opened up recently. Okay. That's notable by itself, but then you're going to click on one of those roles and you can read about it and you're going to see, okay, they're hiring people to collaborate with pre sales teams specifically focused on revenue opportunities, enterprise accounts.\n\nIn that moment, you're probably going to take a glance at the nav bar to and notice that enterprise has its own tab. Nowadays, always an important evolution for a startup when they go from targeting just SMBs and mid market companies to the enterprise. And you might even notice that the landing page not only has the signup for free self service flow, but also has a contact sales feature, which again, showcases the evolution of a company's go to market to be targeting larger companies that require a deeper sales process.\n\nOkay. So again, the demonstrated knowledge that we're building up here. We're going to demonstrate that we're paying attention, that we understand the nuance of what seems to be a shift in strategy from Airtable to the enterprise segment. We're going to demonstrate a curiosity about that strategy.\n\nDepending on our role, that curiosity might be a soft curiosity about just the go to market, or maybe we're adjacent to the go to market motion, and so this is going to be about how that impacts our role. And so maybe the way we want to ask about this is we want to ask about integrations. When you get into selling software into an enterprise company, this is going to be a lot about getting their data in, integrating with other workflows and tools.\n\nAnd so that's what's tough about the pre sales motion. That might be why they're hiring all those solutions consultants. And again, you're going to likely get a visceral reaction of like, yeah, interesting that you noticed that. Enterprise is a huge problem right now, or actually we're growing so quickly that this is to meet all the demand.\n\nBy asking about this, you're giving them something specific to respond to about what's really going on inside the company, feeling like that insider. So again, the way this might sound, I was poking around and noticed a lot of open solutions consultant roles. I'm guessing this has to do with larger enterprise integration, but I'm curious to hear exactly how hands on we get during the process and where that's headed over time.\n\nThis is a really nuanced question because you're also demonstrating some kind of awareness that the need for solutions consultants also implies that the integration moment isn't just self service on the company side. And so you're asking about the process and you're asking about the hiring kind of all in one big package.\n\nThere are layers to this. And again, look at this question. If the person on the other side knows the answer, and we'll talk about that a little bit later, but if they know the answer, this is really easy and fun to respond to. There's a lot of curiosity being demonstrated here and given what's going on inside of air table.\n\nThere's probably a lot of stories to tell in response. All right. This next one is a bit of a fun one. Maybe you're interviewing at the startup read. ai. It's an AI co pilot product that mostly does a lot of meeting transcription work. So basically it summarizes your meetings, records them, gives you transcripts, all that jazz.\n\nAnd you're going to notice something particular when you go to their pricing page. Beyond the pricing itself, they're offering unlimited meeting reports, but at the bottom, you're going to see users get a certain amount of free upload credits. In other words, there's the meetings that once you sign up for read, the copilot probably comes to the meeting, records it itself.\n\nThat's an integrated meeting, but they also allow you to upload recordings either from before usage of read, or maybe there are times when you didn't actually use read, but you have the recording and you want to upload it to get the meeting transcript for the insights. And so those are separate credits.\n\nYou'll notice that in the pricing section, then you're clicking around, looking at the different product features and the different plans available. And you notice that there's some free credits. And then after that, they charge certain amount of cents per minute. You'll notice this is a key feature that they sell on the landing page, but again, it's a lot of nuance here.\n\nIt's a lot of complication. So that's the demonstrated knowledge that you're going to present a very nuanced understanding of both the pricing and the product. Because the reality, and this is a challenging reality, is that it really complicates their pricing page and their feature page. It made me wonder at least, hey, why not just give this feature away for free?\n\nIf you're gonna get great users, just allow them to upload recordings, it won't be that big of a deal. And so I'm guessing about what the founder might say, for example, if I was talking to him. Like are uploaded meanings that important that they need to hold all of this nuance? How many of their users really care about this?\n\nClearly their users care enough so far that they're willing also to pay extra per minute. So maybe some users have a lot of uploaded recordings and that's why they have that feature because some users just have a lot of need in that category, even though most users maybe have zero need enterprise users have a tremendous amount of it.\n\nAgain, there's a lot of nuance here. It's really interesting. It's going to ask about. What's complicated about these uploaded recordings? Why charge in this way? Does it cost more to ingest compared to the integrated meetings? What are the nuances of different customer cohorts that might actually want this feature?\n\nIt's a bit of a challenging question too, but you can ask it completely politely. You're not saying, Hey, why are you doing this weird thing? You're going, Hey, I noticed this. Tell me more about why it is the way it is. The way this might sound, I noticed that uploaded meetings are in a limited credit system.\n\nI'm curious about if there's a cost difference on the read side when you're ingesting these. And how many customers seem to care about uploads versus integrated meetings? This nuance is very findoutable, and the implications of it are super interesting. And almost nobody, if not nobody else, will ask about this.\n\nAnd so you're going to get a product person, an executive, a marketer, somebody to tell you about A conversation that again feels very insidery, showcasing that you care, that you're interested. And again, if it can tie back to your role, even better. Okay. There are a couple of nuances of the framework that I want to cover, but just to recap, we're demonstrating knowledge.\n\nThat's when we're showcasing our nuanced understanding. We're asking the nuance as in we're using the demonstrated knowledge to ask a complicated question about the implications of the demonstrated knowledge. And then we're living the edge. Once we ask that question, we're going to engage on it. We're going to go back and forth.\n\nWe're going to ask followups. Okay. That's all about the framework. Let me give a few nuances as to how to use it. Remember, recruiters don't often know all of the details. So when you're in these early screening conversations, your questions shouldn't be as in depth as when you get to the subject matter experts, they should be more about industry or the company, uh, and its mission and product more broadly.\n\nRecruiters are still looking for super engaged candidates and are often bored by going on autopilot. So you should still try to implement this framework, but remember, they don't often know details that folks further inside the company and interview cycle will know. And that's an important second dynamic to this.\n\nRemember to have the right role nuance. As in, don't ask a go to market question of a software engineer. Unless, by the way, that software engineer was employee number 3 at the company, and you know that they're going to have intel and insight even better. So again, just think about the questions, the demonstrated knowledge.\n\nYou don't want to bring something up that's going to make someone feel embarrassed for not being able to respond to you. But the higher up you go talking to a CEO, talking to an executive, the stretchier you can get asking about anything at the company, because even if they're a product person, if they're a leader, they're gonna have a point of view cross functionally on what's going on in recruiting.\n\nFinance is going to have an opinion on engineering. CEO is going to be able to answer all the questions. So feel free to get really dynamic at that point as to what you're actually curious about, what you actually have learned, what you think has nuance and make sure it makes sense. And that my friends is how you ask great interview questions.\n\nAnd when I tell you great interview questions can win you job offers, I really mean it. It showcases care, understanding. It gets the interviewer energized, which just makes you more memorable. And recall is a huge part of winning job offers. It's that trivial sometimes. It helps you avoid the generic questions that people are tired of answering and that puts their brain on autopilot.\n\nIf you're in a job search or you will be soon, subscribe.
