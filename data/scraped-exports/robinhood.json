The recruiter mentioned there’s a 60-minute coding round in Xcode (Swift or Objective-C) with some starter code, where you implement an unfinished function and discuss trade-offs. For those who’ve done it, was it more logic/LeetCode-style, or did it involve UI or specific iOS APIs (like DispatchQueue, URLSession, Swift Concurrency, etc.)? The screening round earlier felt more like building a small app and shipping it, so I’m trying to get a sense of what to focus my prep on.\n\nAppreciate any insight!\n",

      "body": "I've seen these posts a lot lately in regards to burnout but I think my situation is different in that I just don't enjoy programming at all. Actually I wake up every morning and hate it to the point that I stare a blinking cursor in IDEA before I get distracted by YouTube, Robinhood, Reddit, TikTok, making food and other parts of life that blend work and home. I have a feature to do now that I put off all day and I'm writing this instead.\n\nI despise the grind to get features out - the bullshit carbon-copied structure of standups and retros and 1:1s that are part of all engineering teams - the leetcode pseudo-intellectual interview process - the complete lack of creativity and interpersonal connections and the sheer fact that this industry lacks diversity in so many ways compared to other business functions (ie. many engineers having zero interests outside of their job and those that do falling into a complete nerd-culture stereotype (no judgement just not me), people who are deeply socially awkward to the point they lack self-awareness and empathy, people who are so obsessive that they're overbearing and competitive about work which thereby pressures everyone else to work constantly, etc). I have no idea how to move into something else.\n\nI can do design and PM work well but it's not on my resume as a role and there's no way I see that I could spin it to pay even close to what I make now. I've considered an MBA and moving into finance or healthcare but they're not meritocracies to the extent engineering is and it's a similar situation with pay, cost, and opportunity cost. It would be a fucking longshot to be admitted to even a shit program.\n\nI'm in my late 20s and have no degree. I faked my way into this industry until I found some success. I taught myself basic programming as a teenager to make flash games. I transitioned to front-end dev and started working for startups at 18... right out of HS I tried and failed to start my own company with a student I befriended at Harvard right when he graduated with his Masters in CS (literally met him on Omegle... luckily he made me slightly less of an idiot in the course of a year and got my horrible hobbyist programming skills to the point where I could be semi-employable).\n\nSince then, I've grown my salary yoy from nothing to roughly $300k this year (assuming I make it through this year) which I'm decently proud of and attached to since I didn't grow up with much but I also don't have a ton of savings I'm sitting on. I have a mortgage in a high COL area (&gt;3k a month), a family member with a terminal illness, and a girlfriend who I could see myself settling down with which I really want but is also another looming financial responsibility that keeps me trying to earn more money. I've felt like an imposter for a long time but I worked hard to compensate. Now that I can't find the willpower to, it's really only a matter of time before I'll run into persistent performance issues which is another cause of stress. One company I worked for in 2020 already canned me shortly before my equity vested which was mostly related to the same disinterest and depression manifesting into extreme peaks and valleys of productivity with days of getting fuck all done. I've considered trying to take FMLA but I don't want to fuck my company over and honestly feel like I'd be in the exact same situation as soon as I get back, miserable on day one.\n\nIt's been almost 10 years in this industry - I'm not even 30 and my eyes are completely on retirement. Has anyone felt the same way or ever successfully left engineering? Any advice on how to gtfo without ruining my finances?",

      "body": "I was looking about 6-7 months ago and then searched again last month, and the difference was 10% higher between offers/potential offers just in terms of overall TC.  TC has gone up in general in just half a year.  Now, couple that with the fact that you may time it right with RSU price, it could be very, very worthwhile.\n\nMany companies tend to price their RSUs with a 30-60 day look back.  If you start your search now, you can get an offer in a month or two, and potentially get RSUs at the trough.  And if stocks go even lower by the time you complete the interview processs, you can delay of walk away from an offer.  That's the power of the look-back. If it's going downhill, you can just wait until it goes back up and still take advantage of the dip.\n\nAnd the job market is smoking hot.  Even if we are in a stock correction, there's still some residual heat where companies are still desperate - which means it could potentially be a Goldilocks opportunity.  I interviewed with 4 pretty good companies, and just got 3 offers (2 unicorns, 1 company known to be top paying, and a startup with a founder who has already made billion dollar companies), to go along with an earlier FAANG (non-Amazon) offer.\n\nPercentage wise, the non-startups are like a 30% raise in TC - and I was already getting paid great money already.\n\nThis is just an insane time.

      "body": "Interview failure history:\n\nAmzn-2x reject (did not mind this because I used Amzn on sites to prep for what actual onsites would be like, didn’t actually want to go there)\n\nG- 1x reject (this hurt, got told I was just borderline and asked to do additional rounds after the on-site but didn’t work out)\n\nRobinhood- 1x reject (this hurts because I felt great about this one, they told me coding was exceptional but design was meh)\n\nStripe - reject at phone screen, choked hard on this the question was not hard \n\n~70 other applications that got ignored \n\nRecently somehow convinced FANG(no AMZN because AMZN) to give me an offer despite only having worked at a dead end obsolete company which I won’t share details about but none of the stuff we do is relevant to any other company. Lot of people end up here and just work here forever because they realize they have no transferrable skills and are too busy with family or whatever in life to commit to studying/afraid of failure. Had been thinking about leaving but also had no idea how and felt I had no skills. \n\n3 years ago an Amzn recruiter reached out because I was a human being with a pulse and I was like “wow it’s a mega cap tech company and they’re interested in me?” So I got sent the online assessment and realized I knew nothing about what the hell these questions were or how to code them. Dug into this online and found Leetcode. Sucked at it. Couldn’t solve easy questions to save my life. \n\nBasically spent 1-2 years on and off studying Leetcode. Did about 300 questions. Still failed onsites. Luckily had very little to do at work often so I could practice Leetcode a crap ton. At this point I realized system design was a thing. What the hell is system design? Seemed so vague and nebulous of a concept I had no idea how to get to a state where I could answer these questions.\n\nSimilar to Leetcode, found the usual path of system design prep: YouTube videos, the primer, grokking. Read, watch, re-read, re-watch, do mock interviews.\n\nAll in all, this process took me about 3 years of on and off studying, then giving up for a while, then studying again. I like to travel so there were periods I didn’t practice or apply for jobs. But I eventually always came back. I’m not the smartest by far but I sort of gamified Leetcode in my head to keep my focus. Felt like beating a level when getting an accepted solution. System design is just a lot of practicing talking about what you read. \n\nAnyway fast forward to today. Got the recruiter phone call, wasn’t expecting it. He asked if I had a few minutes at which point I assumed the worst because recruiters usually schedule a time for a longer talk if you actually get an offer. Well somehow I duped them into thinking I’m a competent engineer and offered me probably way too much money. \n\nIf a moron like me can do this you definitely can. For what it’s worth, some things I’ve never done:\n\n- written an API (only read about this for study, seems easy though)\n\n- used git\n\n- done a personal project \n\n- used nosql\n\n\nFor the record I know a lot of people here like to shit on Leetcode and say it doesn’t reflect real work and Leetcode monkeys can’t do anything. And maybe that’s true and maybe it applies to me but I’ll still give it my best effort to be productive when I join. I would say that despite the shit tech stack, my current job did teach me a lot about general office dynamics, cross functional work and iterative testing and the stages a project moves through to completion. \n\nMy final Leetcode numbers for anyone curious:\n\n400ish solved, 60% mediums 30% easy 10% hard\n\n\nThis is a numbers game. You just have to keep interviewing because even when your dream company rejects you, the experience of going through the pressure makes you much better. Sometimes the stars just don’t line up and you get a shit question or interviewer. One of my google interviewers wanted union find which I didn’t know about at the time. It’s sucks. You can get rejected a lot but all you need is 1 offer. My successful interview asked 2 mediums in a coding round but they were question types I was good at, so it was manageable. Eventually things do just click. When I first started the concept of doing 2 medium questions in 45 min was insane. But then one day a couple years later I realized I could do it. This is just a numbers game that takes persistence through failure. Good luck guys",

Maybe it's because I didn't get a CS degree so I didn't learn the fundamentals, but I'm only getting hired by companies that are pretty bad in providing career growth for software engineers. These companies have one or two senior developers, and nothing about the code the make suggests they avoid cowboy programming. \n\nI know that software development goes beyond just closing tickets and fixing bugs so I want to do more now. These companies tend to be on the small side, 10-20 people. But I was afraid of taking the initiative to want more responsibilities and control because I was afraid of stepping on other peoples' toes in such places.\n\nAfter a couple years of slow growth, how am I supposed to interview well enough to get into better companies? They all reject me, either on my resume or at interviews (either phone or on-site). I am mostly applying to mid-level web developer or software engineer jobs, as I have 6 years total experience.\n\nHere is a list of companies I applied to. It's not an exhaustive list, but it's as many as I can remember right now.\n\n* Triplebyte (failed interview, couldn't match me with an employer)\n* BMW Group (rejected on resume)\n* Wyzant (rejected on resume)\n* Zillow (didn't pass 1st phone round)\n* Amazon (didn't pass 2nd phone round)\n* SpotHero (rejected on resume)\n* Concurrency (rejected on resume)\n* M1 Interactive (didn't pass on-site)\n* Futureman Digital (went on-site, then hiring freeze happened)\n* Enova (didn't pass 1st round, needed more experience)\n* Braintree (rejected on resume)\n* Reverb (rejected on resume)\n* PowerReviews (didn't pass 1st round)\n* Strike Social (rejected on resume)\n* Microsoft (their recruiter went AWOL)\n* Shutterstock (no longer needed my experience, as they switched stacks)\n* Morningstar (no response)\n* Uptake (didn't pass 1st phone round)\n* Goldstar Learning (rejected on resume)\n* eSpark Learning (rejected, no fit between my background and open jobs)\n* Civis Analytics (rejected on resume)\n* Shure (didn't pass 1st phone round)\n* Barcodes Inc (didn't pass on-site)\n* Solstice (no response)\n* Vokal (sent resume to engineer, but ghosted)\n* Cloudflare (didn't pass 1st phone round, needed more experience)\n* Coinbase (didn't pass 1st phone round)\n* Robinhood (rejected on resume)\n* Tangocode (didn't pass 1st phone round)\n* Benchprep (rejected on resume)\n\nI'm looking to derive another list from these results, a list of companies that are a good culture and skills fit, but also would provide good career growth.\n\nAll these places I've applied cold. I sometimes try to get through to some friends for help, but because none of my friends work in this area of tech, I have to go to a friend of a friend, and they tend to forget about me (even if I message to remind them).",
