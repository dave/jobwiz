      "title": "Success Story: Pivoting into CS at 32 and going from never making over 45k to 120k as a new grad. After two great life failures, I finally found success in CS.",
      "body": "**Being up front**\n\nBecause I will be sharing many deidentifying pieces of information, I have chosen not to write on my real account. I believe this allows me to share much more detail while still preserving some sense of anonymity. I hope that not only will this additional level of detail, of which seems to be uncommon in success stories will more than make up for any missing credibility by posting on a new account. I do not believe my story is particularly exceptional, but in the end people will need to make up their own mind.\n\nI have provided my background and where I came from because it may help inspire some people. I think success stories are often less impactful than they could be because there is always a sense of \"well you must have had x, or you were privileged in the following y,z ways.\" I don't intend to complete resolve that by sharing my background but rather just to make it less ambiguous. Some people will always have some excuse as to why they weren't or can't be successful. My goal isn't to make it sound like a \"if I can do it, anyone can story.\"\n\n# About me\n\nI grew up in a lower-middle class family in the US. My parents had a nasty divorce when I was young and there was constant custody battles, I attended many schools, had no friends, and was constantly bullied. The police were not uncommon visitors to my house. In high school, things settled and I gained some notion of stability. Up until then, I had no vision of a future, no idea of how I could possibly make it in the world and no confidence. This began to change after I became inspired by the Japanese Anime Dragon Ball Z (yeah I know). It awaken me to the fact that one could self-improve through discipline and perseverance. This initially took the form of physical conditioning and after a while my confidence grew and for the first time I a \"passion.\" From this came my first vision of a future - I set out to join the military with the goal of becoming a Navy SEAL.\n\nI graduated high school (with a 2.1 GPA) and attempted to enroll in the Navy. However, I soon discovered I am medically disqualified from service. I had an undiagnosed kidney issue that barred me from enlisting. However I remained hopeful that if I could get it treated I may still enlist. So I began a 2 year process of treating the disease in hopes that I could get the levels of proteinuria (the diagnostic) to an acceptable level. But after being strung along by recruiters, I eventually got a hold of the recruiting command who said that even if my condition was cured, I would never be elidable for service - in any military service. The mere history of having it was permanently disqualified. That didn't matter in the end because the kidney disease is IgA nephropathy and is incurable and progressive. So here I was back to square one with no hope of a future.\n\nI worked for a time as a fitness instructor and I continued to work on myself, personally. I soon become inspired again. I had always been interested in science, but I never thought I had a future in it.  However, I had gained the confidence to pursue the academic route. I knew I wouldn't get into a decent university with the traditional route given my academic history (GPA 2.1, and ACT 18). So I went to a community college and did very well which allowed me to transfer to a good university from there. I took out student loans to cover tuition and expenses. By this time I was able to claim myself as an independent on the FAFSA and thus allowed me to get enough loans and grants to cover most expenses.\n\nI had set graduate and pursue an MD/PhD. I wanted to practice medicine and I liked science. Most MD/PhD programs are completely funded and thus would allow me financially to pursue an MD. However, I failed in this pursuit. I had one particularly rough semester which sent me into a spiral of depression and self-doubt. I believed that since these programs were extremely competitive, there would be no way I could achieve success. In hindsight, I probably still could have been admitted. A big failure on my part was my failure to seek mental help. I had a certain sense of pride which prevented me from doing so. All my success until had been self-driven and I believed no one but me could help me, I didn't have the capacity to ask for help.\n\nMy depression spiraled and I was at risk of getting dropped from my program (biology). One semester I failed 3 out of the 5 classes I was enrolled in. I eventually completed my required courses by the skin of my teeth and graduated with a 2.7 GPA, but I found myself again (in my eyes) back to square one. Only now with a massive amount of student debt. I realized I could get some lab tech job, but I had no desire to pursue this route. The pay is poor and the work is not intellectually challenging. I was tired of being strapped for cash, living paycheck to paycheck and I thought if my life was worth living, I needed to have a decent income. So I went back to doing what I though could amount to a decent pay - fitness trainer.\n\nI worked as a fitness trainer for a few years but I began to realize, this is a dead-end career for me. It was too intellectually unstimulated and I did not have the personality required for a long and successful career. I hated approaching people and I hated pressuring people to buy training. Eventually I heard about machine learning/deep learning. Up until then, I had no interest in CS or programming. But learning about deep neural networks greatly intrigued me. The level of empiricism involved reminded me of the natural sciences - experimentation, observation, etc. So that's when I started reading about the CS field as whole and I became even more fascinated - not to mention the pay is good.\n\n# My pivot into CS\n\nUntil then, I had presuppositions about what it meant to be a programmer/SWE. One of the big ones I had was that you had to be really good at typing in order to be a successful programmer, which was unappealing to me because I've always sucked at typing and had no confidence I could be proficient to a high level. I have large muscular hands with little finger dexterity. Obviously, I eventually realized this was ridiculous. So now I had my third inspiration for the future - become a software engineer. But with a BS in biology and a 2.7 GPA, I had to find a way to find a way.\n\nAfter researching what the best approach was for me I decided that pursing a masters degree in CS would be best. That way I could feel like my bachelors was not a complete failure and I could theoretically graduate and have a job in just 2 years. I was ineligible for most graduate programs because of my undergrad (most need 3.0 at a minimum). However, I landed on DePaul University's Master of Science in Computer Science which had a 2.5 GPA minimum. Just as important, they allowed you the option to test out of the introductory CS coursework if you can pass the proficiency exams. This was huge for me because it meant I could save over $20000 and graduate a year sooner. The FAFSA direct grad loans were just enough to cover full-time tuition. I applied and was accepted to the program, to begin the following Autumn quarter. This gave me about 5 months to self-study and attempt to pass the proficiency exams (you only get one chance).\n\n# My CS journey\n\nTo do this, I discovered the ample amount of study resources available online. This included, reddit, edx, coursera, and youtube. However, the most valuable resources I discovered came from the open-sourced materials and lectures from elite universities like Berkeley, Stanford, and MIT. I \"audited\" several courses in preparation. Here are the audited courses and the corresponding DePaul courses I used to prepare for.\n\n[DePaul MSCS](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/Current/Requirements-MS-in-Computer-Science.aspx)\n\n[https://cs61a.org/](https://cs61a.org/) (DeNero version)- CSC 401, Intro to CS\n\n[https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/\\~cs61b/fa21/](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa21/) (Hug version) - CSC 402, CSC 403, Data structures\n\n[https://www.eecs70.org/](https://www.eecs70.org/) and [http://imt-decal.org/](http://imt-decal.org/) \\- CSC 400, Discrete math\n\n[CMU Video lectures](https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22b96d90ae-9871-4fae-91e2-b1627b43e25e%22) and [CMU 15-213](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-f15/www/schedule.html) \\- CSC 405, 406, Systems\n\nI also realized that gaining some experience ASAP was crucial, so I began sending out applications for internships anywhere and everywhere. I was lucky enough to encounter a programming internship at a university research center which specialized in biomedical research. I think my bachelors in biology helped me land this even know I had no formal experience in programming. I started the summer before my first quarter began and I worked as an intern there the entire time I was in graduate school.\n\nDuring my studies, I continually supplemented with additional material, auditing other courses. I wanted to land a good job after graduation and while I was glad to be admitted to DePaul's MSCS, the program was weak and I knew if I wanted a good job I would have to go above and beyond the coursework. I graduated with a 3.9 GPA and landed a new grad role at a F100 making 120k in a med CoL area at 34 years old.\n\nI prepared for new grad roles through all the ways you frequently read about on here. Grinding leetcode (about 30 easy, 80 med, 10 hard over 2 months), doing mock interviews on platforms like Pramp, and applying to lots of places. I couldn't grind any more than that because I was working (20 hours/week) and going to school fulltime. I failed several interviews. However, all you need is one success and eventually I found it.",

      "body": "I'm wondering if anyone can chime in on this issue I'm having. I graduated from a very solid school around 2 years ago with a CS degree and currently have a nearly perfect job that is remote and pays well enough. However, I keep sabotaging myself. Since the remote lifestyle in school meant more free time to smoke pot and play video games, my brain has gotten used to that notion. I don’t do nearly enough work and I feel like any progress that I make on tasks takes actual ages. This in turn leads to the imposter syndrome and now I really can’t tell if I’m just not cut out for this, as even simple stuff takes forever to understand. Sooner or later I’m sure this will get brought up and I will be let go, likely to never return to CS again because of how insanely difficult it is to get hired ATM, which sucks because I’m part of a talented team and I like working with everyone. I got really lucky with this job and didn’t have to grind any Leetcode or do any tech interviews also… I feel like I should be trying to hold onto it with everything I got, yet I’m still not able to force myself to sit down and do work. In fact, I haven’t been able to consistently work on my CS skills adhering to a schedule since COVID started. I enjoy some aspects of coding and even have fun occasionally while doing it but without anyone monitoring me, I just slack off. My question is, how did y’all get to the stage of absolutely loving the process and replacing pointless activities such as video games with learning new SE skills and just getting better and better in your own time on your own terms. I feel like the  only way I will succeed in this career is to cut out all of the bs and just fckin focus. It seems like such a simple and obvious concept without any special trick: just grind now and reap the benefits later… But, while it makes sense in my head, putting this into action has been an issue for years and years at this point. Would appreciate any tips on how to make my brain not be my biggest enemy.",

      "body": "I feel this type of obligatory post for this subreddit, so here it is. A bit about myself, I returned to school for computer science in my 30's. I came from a healthcare background where I worked in the realm of physical therapy. I started school in 2018 and finished in 2021. Due to some circumstances, I could not get any internship experience, and I knew this was going to hinder me.\n\nThe process was tedious. There were 400 or so job applications. 200 LC questions, which I actually enjoyed and will continue to do them.  I worked on three different side projects. I received plenty bunch of \"We love your personality/enthusiasm, but we need someone with more experience.\"  I eventually reached a point of stopping caring, or I was numb to the generic email rejection. When I achieved that mindset, things were much more freeing.\n\nIn the last few weeks, I casually entertained the hiring process with different companies and attended career fairs. In one career fair, I had some was quick banter with someone, and I was invited for an interview a few days later.  After that, I offered me an SRE position. I conditionally accepted it. They said it's fully remote, FT, full benefits, and unlimited PTO. There is room for me to move laterally and vertically.\n\nThey asked about my salary range, and I said I'd need to get back to them since I didn't research this topic much. After some research and discussion with other people in the field, I concluded on $80000 - $85000. They agreed.\n\nA couple of days later, I got another call from a company that I interviewed with, and they offered me a $100000 full-stack role, but they have a hybrid working model. I asked them to give me a few days to decide.\n\nWith the help of this subreddit,  with the notion, \"It is okay to ask for more money. \" I decided that I would ask for a small salary bump from the original company. I asked them for $92500, to which they agreed.\n\nYes, I know this isn't FANG money, but I don't care. The position is entirely remote, with good benefits and good PTO. Furthermore, with no internship experience, I'd be a bloody fool to say no. As well, I confirmed this is more of a SWE engineering role that, DevOps, so I'll be writing code, which I'm excited for\n\nThe silly thing about this whole interview process for this company. . .I wasn't asked a single LC question.",

      "title": "Outsourced my job hunt to a virtual assistant and got hired",
      "body": "# Quick facts\n\n- I had a ~3% conversion rate to interview from purely Virtual Assistant (VA) applications\n    - 240 applications\n    - 8 interviews total\n    - 4 of the companies I was actually interested in\n- Cost: $0.70 per application after trial period (Not including a slightly higher rate I paid for during a trial period with the VA). YMMV with this as it depends on how you negotiate.\n- Hired a SWE based out of LatAm looking to do additional gig work\n- I’m a US based SWE looking for a mid level role\n- ~20 hours of work to go from zero to first non-trial period application submitted by VA.\n\nThe way I see it, there a 2 approaches to a job hunt: \n\n1. High volume, and low precision. This is just applying to a large enough number of jobs with goal of a few percentage converting.\n2. Low volume, and high precision. This would be networking, carefully crafted emails, attending in person recruiting events, etc…\n\nThe rest of this post details how I outsourced the first part.\n\n# The Process\n\n### Finding a VA\n\nI found a VA through Upwork, which seemed to have higher quality freelancers than other platforms like Fiverr. I specifically looked for someone familiar with software engineering to navigate the nuances in terminology across different applications. I created a job post on Upwork, inputting all my main asks into ChatGPT to generate a comprehensive job posting detailing the kind of job I was looking for and what my expectations were for the VA. After posting, people applied to the job or I could invite freelancers I knew on the site to apply.\n\n### Interviewing\n\nI found it critical to conduct interviews and do a test run with a few candidates. During the interviews, I looking to quantify their performance but also considered intangible factors like their listening skills, empathy, and ability to pitch ideas. I was also looking to answer questions like Do they have experience doing this or similar work? How much do they know about the industry? How fluently do they speak English?\n\n### Test run\n\nFor the test run, I created a Notion document with a detailed list of my censored/aliased information, preferences, and answers to common application questions. I also them to submit a link to each job they applied to via a form that I tracked in a Notion database. This allowed me to verify if they applied to jobs that I was genuinely interested in and if they completed the required amount of jobs. I selected three individuals for the test run, each tasked with applying to 40 jobs and sending me a report halfway through. I gave them feedback once they sent in the report, which helped me gauge how well they followed instructions and received feedback.\n\n### Hiring\n\nWhen it came to hiring, I preferred milestone-based payment over hourly as it was more measurable and transparent to both of us as opposed to hourly work. We ended up agreeing on milestones of 100 applications for $70. Every 100 applications I would review the work before starting another set.  \n\n### Process and Workflow\n\nFor the process and workflow, I emphasized privacy and security by using Google Voice and an email alias on my resume. Thank god I did because some VAs applied to jobs via some sketchy sites even though I told them not to. \n\nDefinitely agree on a deadline for the work. Whenever I have not timeboxed work with a VA it basically never gets done unless I follow up multiple times. \n\nTracking jobs they applied to in Notion not only let me collect data on the job hunt, but also doubled as a small project management tool where I could set the status of where in the process I was with a job, add any notes, etc…\n\n# Takeaways\n\n- Vibe matters —like any job I asked “Is this someone I would actually enjoy working with?”. Some of the VAs I interviewed were pushy, couldn’t communicate well, etc…\n- Keep the search targeted (e.g. focusing on frontend eng roles vs any tech job)\n- Keep it simple. start with simple tasks before expanding the scope and complexity of work.\n- Be explicit and patient. I found that early on I needed to be extremely explicit about how I wanted something done, and over time I was able to trust the VA to be independent.\n- Don’t micromanage. I found that adding too much process and oversight ultimately ended up wasting so much of my own time that I may as well have applied to the jobs on my own. Letting the VA do their thing made the process much smoother. This worked because I ended up choosing someone who I worked well with and trusted.\n\n*tl;dr Hired and trained a virtual assistant to apply to a few hundred jobs for me so I could focus on networking and interviewing. Got a job.*",

      "body": "This pertains specifically to the company that is in Florida since there are about two or three other small companies that have this same name (seemingly it would be a popular choice for this field of work).\n\nBasically, they take advantage of their workers as much as possible. How they do that might vary from person to person but here's my experience.\n\nI actually got referred to the founder of the company by someone else on Reddit, who is just a second hand connection to this guy. Company founder was looking for more contractors to work for him and he was interested in my experience. The company is a web agency that mostly hires remote contractors.\n\nWe had just one phone interview that lasted about an hour, no take-home test or rigorous technical questions or exercises. He seemed convinced to hire me, we agreed upon the rate I settled on for some $X an hour. As with my previous contract jobs I always charge per clock hour of work and that's how I thought he'd be basing the agreement on.\n\nThe following Monday he sent me an email with an NDA attached and instructions on how to get set up. He has client projects already on the pipeline and I was assigned to one. I log into GitLab with my new credentials to look it over.\n\nI submitted the signed NDA then looked at the tasks available on Gitlab and so far this seems pretty normal for a remote job. I got to chat with one of the senior devs who was also working on that project.\n\nImmediately I noticed the tasks had a set number of hours written next to it. \"Fix bug A - 4 hrs\", \"Implement some new search feature - 6 hrs\", stuff like that. I PM'ed the business owner about this. he said, that's just how much I should be billing for the client. And he also followed up with an email saying, you are required to only bill for the amount stated on the tasks, or the time it took you to finish the tasks, *whichever is shorter*. In addition to that, self-training, research and other related work is not considered billable work time.\n\nAside from that he expects me to be online for chat 9 through 5 even though I am allowed to work when I want to. I don't know if this is \"on call\" but either way, this wasn't discussed over the phone and neither was the stuff about tasks having predetermined hourly estimates by their lead developer. \n\nI asked him to produce a contract because I won't work without one, founder said they don't do written agreements. So I also asked the senior dev about it and he said not to worry because he's been working for half a year and *he has not been given a written contract either*. \n\nAnd I'm thinking, is this really all right with him? Without a written contract, you have no way of doing anything about it if that happens, other than walk out and say good bye to the work you've done and money you've earned.\n\nApart from that, their notion of wanting to pay you only what their lead determines he would need is outrageous. After all I should be setting the estimates for my own work. I'm not paid the rate of a senior developer, and that is because I'm not as fast, and also because this was using a framework I've never used before. But with these hourly estimates what they want is the speed of a senior programmer at the rate of a junior programmer.\n\nI only did two tasks before I decided to hold off if the founder wasn't going to renegotiate or present a signable entity. On Wednesday he told me he was terminating my contract because I did not appear on chat at the expected hours, and was nagging him about terms of pay. But setting terms in writing is some basic company 101 stuff. I don't know if he's just used to such informality but it wasn't working for me.\n\nIn particular, I shouldn't have let them get away with that \"senior programmer estimates\" BS. But if they refuse to even entertain the idea, or if they refuse to come to reasonable terms with you, it wasn't surprising that they refuse to pay me for the few hours of work I did do. I didn't completely dodge a bullet- because I lost time with them- but it could have been much worse.",

What happened to them? So many posts/comments stating that the market isn't close to saturated, etc. It turns out all of those people were wrong then, and they are wrong now. Those same people are now stating that only junior dev positions are saturated, but mid/senior are not. Mid level is already saturated, and senior will be in 2-5 years when the glut of mid level developers reaches senior level.\n\n3) What happened to CS is what happened to law/pharm in the past decade\n\n- Massive openings of training programs (bootcamps, CS curricula, etc.) lead to a glut of new workers. Wages will stagnate and likely decrease. CS is even more unique that law/pharm as there is no governing body limiting student output. \n\n\nTLDR: Only go into CS if this is truly what you see yourself doing, as competition is fierce and will continue to be fierce for another 3-5 years before people begin admitting to themselves that the market has reached oversaturation, and pursuing a CS degree will be seen similarly to pursuing a law degree at a non T14 school (waste of time and money, with little financial reward).\n\n",

      "body": "Before I plunked down 18.5k for Hack Reactor this last fall, I tried to do some due diligence about the program by way of reddit, quora, other forums.  While I found no shortage of testimonials, it was odd that there were almost no negative online reviews.   I found an anonymous post that said this was due to dropouts having to sign nondisclosure agreements, and a more detailed review from an HR alum on Hacker Noon, but there was not much out there otherwise. I thought the NDA thing was kind of weird, and maybe I should have taken that as a warning.  But I had previously graduated from a chemical engineering program and law school, both with honors, and I did not think making it through their program was something I would have to worry about.\n\nTurned out, my faith in past academic performance was greatly mistaken. I crashed and burned brutally about halfway through their immersive.  Not too long after, I get an email from Hack Reactor asking me to sign the agreement I have posted a link to below.  If you look at it, you will see the NDA thing was not an urban legend.  Instead, it is the tip of the iceberg.  The thing I got is pretty draconian, asking a student to hold HR harmless from any future claims and also to take on a number of additional liabilities (e.g., the disparagement and NDA clauses), in exchange for mostly just a refund, which the student is already entitled to per the terms of the enrollment agreement.  Understanding this, and being more than a little upset about how everything had turned out, I refused to sign. Did Hack Reactor argue with me over signing or withhold the refund?  No.  Instead, they  informed me for the first time that signing was optional.\n\nThis is just my opinion, but I would guess students sign these things out of ignorance, and that the agreements are part of the reason there is so little negative feedback to be found online about HR bootcamps...\n\n[Separation Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oevlkokNhw_8HQ_N30w5yhTsMo5NeJfw/view?usp=sharing)\n\n—————————————————— **UPDATE - 10/31/2019** ——————————————————\n\nA few months ago, somebody on this thread asked what I was \"doing now\".  I didn't want to answer until I had something to show for myself. So here it is:\n\n**additional training**\n\nAfter the boot camp did not work out, I spent another 8 months teaching myself.  To do that, I picked a full-stack app idea that I knew would require me to learn all the things Hack Reactor had expected me to learn. An idea that would not take long to start coming together, but that could be built out to any level of detail and complexity I had time for.\n\nEvery time I wanted to learn something new, I would study up and then integrate that new \"thing\" into the app. If that meant tons of refactoring, that was ok.  Because it was practice... Good for muscle memory, good for my debugging skills, and lots of lessons about what not to do as a project gets bigger. If I wanted to learn more than one way to do something, I would just rewrite the whole thing.   In this way, a MySQL database and its associated queries became Postgres, Request API calls became Axios, and React class components were gradually replaced by hooks. Bootstrap was added, then excised in favor of MUI, which in turn was heavily modified using the styled components library.  It was practice with a purpose.\n\nMy goal was not to look for a job until I had created from scratch and successfully deployed a modern professional-looking full-stack app all by myself.  Instead of doing five shitty projects, I wanted one awesome one.  Actually it became two, but the point is I had something great to show employers.  And I had something concrete to base self-confidence on.\n\nActually that last bit about confidence is also why I took so long before I started looking.  By the end of my time at Hack Reactor I may have been comfortable with basic javascript programming (thank you extended prep course), but  I was pretty damn confused about everything else.  By everything else, I mean all the employable stuff built on top of JS: React, Rest, Node... I could barely get a list to render in React.  The thought of worming my way into some company by memorizing a bunch of stupid toy problems, but without actually having the skills and experience necessary to meaningfully contribute, was not appealing,\n\n**the results** When I finally started looking for a job it was like pulling teeth.  I did not want to do it.  I shotgunned maybe 100 applications (half to postings by recruiters) with almost no follow-up.  Then  I let the days go by...intentionally ignoring the fact that I was going to lose my home if I didn't get my ass in gear.\n\nNo matter.  After 30 days of thumb-twiddling the jobs found me.  Suddenly I had three interviews a few days apart. One was for Hilton that I got through a recruiter, A second interview with a software consultancy, that I got by flirting with their in-house recruiter on LinkedIn (not really flirting but more fun to say it that way). The third was a document processing company.  Of the three, Hilton was a sure thing... until I choked on a softball question (oops); the second place hired me; the third place sounded awful so my feelings were not hurt when they didn't call me back,\n\nI did well with the first two employers in large part because they had challenge problems to work on at home.  I wanted both jobs badly so I went crazy on those problems... and I smoked my competition.  Which is to say, spending the time to learn all that stuff really paid off.  Instead of applying to ten million jobs and half-assing gateway challenges in bulk, I spent a week each on two companies and guaranteed myself an offer.\n\nI have been working now as a software consultant for about a month.  I am happy to say it is the best company I have ever worked for.  The pay could be better, but then again Nerdwallet's cost-of-living calculator estimates my salary where I live is about what $115000 would get you in SF, who is on par with HR's results.\n\n**what I knew then; what I know now** As a mentioned above, I could barely put a component up on the screen by the time I was  shuttled out of the program.  But 8 months later I had made [this](https://timelockr.hillert.dev) by writing [this](https://github.com/jehillert/timelockr-client)  and [this](https://github.com/jehillert/timelockr-server).  \\[UPDATE: And just so we do not conflate bootcamp success with one's ability to figure s\\*\\*\\* out on their own, a year after \"this and this\", I learned React Native on my own and created [this personal project](https://github.com/jehillert/modicum-timelockr-app) that combines React Native, redux, redux saga, an Android native module and an ACaaS backend service to control a Bluetooth smartlock.\\]\n\nMaybe my project doesn't look like much to experienced developers, and maybe another newbie could have made something twice as nice in the same amount of time. But the process and the product got me my job, and I seem to know what I am doing now that I have started working.   All in all, I feel like the project taught me orders of magnitude more than what I was getting out of the immersion by the time I got bumped.\n\n**3-month bootcamps are stupid** With the acknowledgement that this \"update\" is turning into a meandering pile of crap, let me just say something to those who are contemplating self-study over a bootcamp.\n\nFirst, I question that notion that a bootcamp gets you there any faster.  I met tons of people in Hack Reactor who, had to take part of the immersion over, failed the prep course multiple times, took extra time for extended prep sessions.  Those guys were easily studying full time for 75-100 percent longer than bootcamp marketing execs would have you believe.\n\nSecond, Hack Reactor staff were very clear that a job search could take 3-5 months, and I suspect a fair portion of HR alum spend 6-9 months.  So while HR grads spend three months in the immersion and end up spending 3-9 months looking for a job, I spent 9 months training and 1 month looking. As job hunting sucks balls, I'd say I got the better deal.\n\nThird, if you are in to your 20's and living at home, grab some adderall and self study all day and all the way. It is more fun, and way less stressful.But I should say I went into this with a ton of debt and really played russia  roulette.  I would t recommend what I did to anyone with debt or a family.\n\nSo yeah, that's what happened with me...",

          "body": "\\[I moved this up from where I originally posted it since several people asked similar questions while I was writing.  The original question asked whether my original post was trying to say that Hack Reactor (Galvanize) is bad.\\]\n\nNo, I would not say they are bad. To be honest, HR's 'extended' prep course, which I took as a lead-up to the immersive, was the best educational experience of my life. The main instructor and his aids were fantastic in every way. They took us would-be coders as far as we were capable of going in the short time that they had us.\n\nBut my experience in the prep course is actually part of what made it all the more surprising when I finally got into the immersion for real and quickly found myself crushed like a can of Campbell's in an MRI. The prep course is designed to prepare students for the rigors of the immersion but the immersion is a different beast altogether. It is novel, it is unconventional, and it has the lofty goal of turning a person into an adaptable, flexible, self-reliant 'do-er' in three months time. It is so unique that I cannot honestly pass judgement on it without context.\n\nWhich brings me to my actual point. I do not know whether my problem with Hack Reactor (Galvanize) was that I suck or that Hack Reactor is almost impossible for most people to make it through. If it is the latter, than I want all my money back, and maybe some of that 8-9k a month of income I have been giving up to make the switch to tech. But Hack Reactor appears to have silenced all the people I could have learned that information from, a strange move for a company that is fiercely proud of their methods. And since they are silenced, all I have is anecdotal evidence to answer the most important questions. Questions that would have been absolutely relevant to whether I would have gone with Hack Reactor in the first place. Questions like the following:\n\n**What is the true graduation rate?**\n\nHow have others done, really, in this program? Do 97% make it through like one of the Hack Reactor founders states in a 2016 Quora post? Or do 50% flame out with a $12,000 hole in their pocket? On one hand, I know of several cohorts where almost everyone made it through. On the other hand, I know of two of two in Cali that started with about 40 students each, and were down to 26-27 mid-course. I met three people where on their second attempt at making it through the immersion, one of whom was still struggling, and that was in a cohort of less than 20.\n\nAnother wrinkle is what 'graduate' means. Myself and a few others were 'threatened' (may be too strong a word) with non-graduating status if we insisted on staying the course in spite of ourselves. This meant we would be allowed to complete the program, but not call ourselves graduates of Hack Reactor. Funny thing about that, my Enrollment Agreement specifically defines the “\\[n\\]umber of On-Time Graduates” as \"the number of students who completed the program within 100% of the published program length within the reporting calendar year.\" So are those students being included in the graduation rate? If so, are they also included in the job stats? And if their graduation rate is so high, why is it that the mechanisms for dealing with the rejects appear to be have been honed to a razor sharp edge?\n\n**How long does it take to get through the program, really?**\n\nThe immersion itself is three months long. But several people in my class indicated that they were taking the immersion for the second time, having failed or drowned in their first attempt. And while the basic immersion prep course is about a month long, I talked to several people who had taken the prep course multiple times and/or failed the technical interview multiple times. Had I graduated, I myself would have 7 months invested with Hack Reactor at this point. Which is funny, because I only now feel like I know enough to have had a chance of making it through.",

      "body": "There's a pretty evident draw for new grads (and potential interns) to work at companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon and whatever other companies are in the \"big 4.\" Whether that be for the salary, options, benefits, perks, being around \"smart\" people - doesn't matter. Point is, lots of these candidates are focused on getting jobs at these companies and only these companies, overlooking opportunities that might be more suitable, based on factors above and - very applicably - social pressure.\n\nI’m an intern at one of these companies now and I’ve only been here for 6 weeks so it’d be worth taking this post with a grain of salt. There’s an excessive sense of elitism - especially amongst the interns. A sense that because they are working at company X in the “big 4” that they are almost entitled to jobs at Y and Z in the “big 4.” This is not an attractive atmosphere to work in at all. If the interns aren’t talking about this, they’re talking about interview prep for next season. It’s a mix of cockiness and elitism. Granted, not everyone is like this. Many also have a sense of humbleness. But at least where I’m working, the number with the former ideologies far surpass the percentage with the latter.\n\nMore often than not, people working at big companies are not working on anything revolutionary. The press and media will highlight cool projects from any company, but most of the active revenue streams come from products that are as boring as Elon’s tunnel company (that’s a joke). So for people who say their end goal is to work at Google or Microsoft, realize that based purely on statistics, you’re not going to be contributing much to Waymo or Hololens. A lot of it comes down to satisfaction where you tell someone that you work at Google or Microsoft and then their reaction to it, knowing that you probably are really smart and interview really well and have a really good resume. This boils down eloquently to a term I like to call: “overhype.” (Sure, you can always interview into specific teams, but many times, they require specific skillsets and all the time require a certain deal of luck).\n\nSo I’ve toyed with the idea of straying away from these kind of companies (which include the aforementioned ones as well as unicorns and others). I enjoyed working at a rapidly growing, mid-size startup that no one’s really heard of last summer so figured I would look into those kind of companies. Very quickly though, purely due to social pressure and peers, this doesn’t seem like the wise thing to do. There’s no name or brand recognition with that, even if you have a somewhat comparable compensation package. Not only is there this “goal” of working for these large companies, there’s this notion imposed on others that if you aren’t working there now and not trying to work there later, you’re not doing it right.\n\nIt’s important to put our lives in perspective before we get too engulfed in these, what I like to call them, conceptual fallacies. And for the many of us that are already deep in it, it’s worth hearing:\n\nSaying that we are blessed to be in a situation where we’re considering even applying (and some of us choosing between) working at these kind of companies is an understatement.\n\nIt’s hard for me to imagine that it’s even possible to live comfortably with a salary orders lower than what we’ll be (or are) making, with perks and benefits that are not remotely comparable, and with a lifestyle that’s completely different.\n\nMy last point boils down to the following: if you know you’re capable of working at the companies everyone “wants” to work at, but are declining with full cognizant awareness, what does that say about you and what will people think? In hyperbolic speak, you are giving up the opportunity to work with the “elite” to work with the “normal” and you’re giving up “brand” recognition.\n\nIf you got through reading this, what I’m really trying to find out are the pros and cons of both and, in general, just your opinions on it all.",

They wanted me to reaffirm my interest (even though I have no track or recollection of applying, I checked everywhere and am tracking my application in Notion) by just replying **\"YES\", in bold.** I thought that was weird so I replied as a normal human being instead of being prompted through an SMS bot.\r\n3. The offer is $15k more than the range I gave, but no negotiation on that happened?\r\n4. Now for big red flag 1: the offer letter implies the company has various departments and its own server, but for a company of that size **there is no information on them anywhere.** Not on LinkedIn, can't find the person who I'm contacting on LinkedIn, no Glassdoor either. I can only find a website and an empty Instagram page. \r\n5. Big red flag 2: **The website was half-baked** in design, missing/filler text, not at all descriptive, just in general not finished. I say \"was\" because it was working when I responded to their interest in me yesterday. When I went to look at the company site again today, **the site no longer exists,** my browser says the site cannot be reached. On their Insta page, there is a site link that takes me to same address but not secure, which is also not working now but instead of a connection issue, its **a GoDaddy page** saying the domain is provided by them.\r\n6. Last red flag 3: I at least have the address of the company (which was in the questionnaire for some reason??, but not the company name lmao), but after a quick google search, its just the **address of a virtual mailbox company.**\n\nKeep in mind, I don't even know what the exact position details are besides what you will typically find on a job post. I'm not comfortable considering this as anything but a scam, but I want to make sure I'm not crazy. Am I being overly critical/cautious here or is this genuinely fishy?

I cant think of any software i need which doesnt already exist. And anything i do might already have 1000 similar github projects.\n\n* 2) I feel like too many people upload projects that are 2 days worth of casual coding but overglorify it by catchy terms like \"advanced distributed CI/DI  for container controlled microservices with framework integration with react.vue.potato.js\" when in reality it just spawns a spring boot controller.I want to avoid making something hipster but useless like that that will probably worsen the interview position.\n\n* 3) JavaEE/Spring are used mostly on enterprises so since i dont have an enterprise or worked in one , i have no idea what sample project could be relevant. You cant make a game or a chat or something common. \n\n* 4) I was thinking about contributing to an OSS but it takes a tremendous time and in the end no interviewer will bother looking at your commits etc especially when they wont be anything major? Also not sure if i want to dedicate so much time to lets say fixing bugs on spring which is only 1 technology and irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.Is that notion wrong? \n\n\nI would really appreciate your help.

Apparently, the employer was surprised by how much he knew about API development as an intern applicant! So if you're in a similar spot, I hope you share the same success through this material.\n\nPlease note that there are no strings attached.

You also don't wrap responses in envelopes with messages; just a 200 status when a post is created successfully is okay.

Most notably, two top threads today [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5rorr1/my_friend_and_i_had_too_different_interviews_how/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5rlijr/software_development_how_would_you_behave_with_a/), kept reinforcing the notion that oftentimes, when a woman gets a job at a tech company, it's often got it due to their gender. Seriously, you all should be ashamed of yourselves. All of these unsubstantiated allegations from anonymous people are being upvoted and giving women in tech a bad name. \n\nWomen in tech have it insanely hard. Imagine being the only dude in a nursing program and you can see what these women are going through. Additionally, imagine if all of your accomplishments were ridiculed by everyone because \"you only got this job/promotion/project/etc. cause you're a girl.\" That would really suck and would totally destroy your confidence. \n\nTBH, for me, the women I know in tech are some of the best engineers I've ever met. I know that this is anecdotal, but the women on my team are entrusted with the largest and most important projects. They regularly deliver outstanding results and they are critical to the success of our (very large and very important) product at a Big 4. There are only three of them on our team of 20, but without them, our team and our product would fall apart.\n\nCollectively, as men in tech, we need to do a better job of calling out sexism and supporting women in tech at all levels. The gender ratio is appalling and embarrassing and reflects very poorly on our industry. It is partially a societal issue because society does not expect women to become software engineers. But if you think that men in tech are free of all blame, then you are a part of the problem. We need to encourage and mentor women in tech. I'm not saying that all men are part of the problem, but collectively, we are the problem.  **We need to stop pretending that the problem doesn't exist and start asking ourselves what can we do to fix the gender gap.** Listing anecdotes of \"reverse sexism\" that you think you've experienced does not count.\n\nI'm not saying that some tech companies don't offer positions to less qualified applicants because they're women. It happens, and when it does, it sucks. It's not fair to men or women when it does. However, that's a minuscule problem compared to the sexism that women experience every day in the office and classroom. The levels of women in CS at top companies and at top CS programs is relatively comparable, so when people assume that women are less qualified, it's saying that men are smarter than women, which is wrong and incredibly demoralizing to the women who are trying their hardest to succeed.\n\nYou may not be sexist at the office, and I applaud you if you aren't. But being sexist on the internet isn't much better. You may not say anything sexist at the office or on the internet, and you may actually be a feminist, but your failure  to call out and challenge sexist men is deafening. We should all be proactive in calling out and fighting sexism, wherever it is.\n\nAnd before anyone dismisses me as a pissed off woman, I'm actually a pissed off straight white male. \n\nI'm very open to a discussion about this, but I think we can all work together to making the tech industry and CS programs nationwide more accepting for women. Think about how much better our industry, our jobs, and our classrooms would be if we eliminated the gender gap. Let's all be leaders in making it happen.\n\nEDIT: Grammar and formatting",

Too much *data* really. Sometimes there is also talking to clients who have no idea what they paid for and things get really annoying.\n\nHowever I love math and straight up programming. I'm fortunate since the company likes my work and I've been assigned to challenging projects. Lots of Python and SQL obviously, some stuff in C# which I'm finding an extremely interesting language. Since I'm mostly given semi-isolated tasks, some of the challenges of everyday coding end up being solved, whenever it's reasonable, using a mathematical notion or trick (say, posets/maximality, partitioning sets a certain way, modular arithmetic...).\n\nSo this is where I'm at. Fairly happy with the job/career/daily work, but needing something else. Possible next steps? Probably learning C++. With what purpose? No idea, I'm probably gonna like it for it's own sake.\n\nThis seems like a great sub to formulate my question, though I'm finding it hard to do: am I missing on a specific CS career that actually has a mathematical background? Well, I know there many such careers, but I'm looking for one that does not require a PhD. Hence the \"low tier\" in the post title.\n\nAs an example: I would imagine that a graphical software engineer would have a strong grasp on euclidean vector spaces or even general topology (just an idea, i know next to zero about graphical software engineering). Or maybe that a developer working on a database engine would know a lot about computational complexity.\n\nExtremely grateful for any insight!",

      "body": "Why is it the majority of technical interviews these days focus so heavily on usage of algorithms. I googled this question, and I only came up with results that had \"algorithms and data structures\" linked together.\n\nI understand the need behind understanding data structures. Almost everything (at least in the OO world) has some usages of data containers, and it's important you understand how to manipulate that data.\n\nPeople then argued this is where the algorithms came in. I have a hard time with this. I've only been out of college and in industry for three years, but the majority of my jobs have focused on creating client-server relationships, and dividing applications into subsystems, establishing methods of communicating/sharing data across subsystems, implementing a CRUD model for persistent storage.\n\nMaybe it's the fact that I've never had to work in a code-base from scratch. Everything I fall into either already exists and we're porting it or mid development and we're just implementing all the requirements.\n\nI guess maybe the notion here is that algorithms are usually easy to define problems that you can create clear requirements to solving. However sometimes these algorithms asked in these interviews are seemingly complex(and most of the time actually simple once you realize there is an elegant solution involved).\n\nFor example, I was recently asked in an interview a question about rotating a square matrix 90 degrees. Jokes on them, I happened to work this same problem while studying up for the interview, but when I initially tried to solve this, I ended up with a solution that was exponential in time, and constant in space. After searching for results, I found the algorithm is very simple.\n\nTranspose the matrix(linear time, constant space)\nswap rows of the matrix( linear time, constant space)\n\nI ended up with a top down design of the problem in my interview. Everyone was very impressed, and they were like \"well since you were such a rockstar with that, can you rotate it the other way\"...I offered two solutions, perform the operation multiple times, or provide a direction flag to the function and swap rows one direction ,and swap columns the other direction).\n\nAfter blazing through this, they asked me if I had seen this problem before, and I didn't lie. My interviewer was furious, and told me that I shouldn't have wasted their time, they could have gave me a different problem.\n\nTo this I informed them about in todays world, most problems exist in the form of many smaller problems, and the first step to solving these problems if you don't know the solution, is to quickly check if someone else has solved it.\n\nThere was some back and fourth discussion on this, but the interviewer ended the interview with the statement that \"Apparently I don't understand the purpose of technical interviews\".\n\nAnd now I'm here. Because maybe I don't...",

          "body": "Here's my understanding:\n\n* Algorithms are asked in interviews because they offer a universal way of testing programming ability.  Suppose I don't ask algorithmic questions.  Maybe I ask you to implement a contact form for my-bookstore.com.  What happens if you don't know web development?  You could still be a great candidate, but I would never know.  Or maybe I ask you to write an iOS app that does X.  If you've never done mobile development, then you're screwed.  So what do I ask instead?  Maybe something like, \"Hey, I want a pagination control on some interface.  If I have X pages and Y items per page, how do I figure out what results to show on page Z?\"  But now we have an algorithms problem.  Algorithms capture the essence of programming that isn't domain-specific.  While some algorithms are domain-specific, those aren't the kind of algorithms that should be asked in an interview question.  You might argue that domain-specific interviews are OK if the candidate is given time.  Software engineers are supposed to be good learners, right?  Maybe you give a take-home test.  The problem is that not everyone has time to do a take-home test (some people have husbands/wives and/or kids, activities, responsibilities, or other commitments).  Also, I would argue that past experience is directly related with one's ability to learn a new topic in a similar domain.  Someone with a web development background, for example, might be able to pick up mobile development faster than someone else because she already understands MVC, etc.\n* Algorithms provide an interviewer with a way of seeing how well a candidate learns.  Everyone knows that they should learn algorithms before a technical interview (or they learn very quickly otherwise).  It is understood that candidates prepare for an interview by learning algorithms.  If I, as an interviewer, ask you an algorithms question, I can determine whether you are capable of learning tough technical topics.  The hope is that an interview question will depend on some algorithmic knowledge but that during the actual interview evaluation/analysis/synthesis will be required.  If you know the answer to the question 100% ahead of time, then I can't see how you approach a problem that you don't immediately know the answer to.  This is why your interviewer was frustrated.  You provided him or her with some information (that you are able to write code and evaluate  different options), so it's not all for loss.  However, the interviewer is also looking to see how you combine foundational knowledge to arrive at new solutions to problems.  You weren't able to demonstrate that since you had already seen the problem.\n* Like you said, algorithms are easily scoped.  You said that sometimes algorithms presented in interviews are asked in a complex way.  This does not indicate that asking algorithms questions is a bad approach.  Rather, it indicates that some people ask bad algorithms questions (or struggle to ask them correctly).",

Go through Full Stack Open or the Odin Project and build a personal website so that employers can see my side projects\n3. Post my projects on Github and create clean READMEs for recruiters to see\n4. Reach out to whoever I know that currently works in tech (I was born and raised in the Bay Area and did also go to undergrad nearby) and try my best to get as many referrals as possible along with applying to jobs using LinkedIn and Indeed\n5. If all else fails, enroll in OMSCS next month and try to get an internship while being in a part-time masters\n\nI would really appreciate it if you guys could critique my plan or point me in the right direction if you feel like I might be missing something or if I am simply being too naive.\n\n**TLDR: I'm a recent Biology graduate who wants to get a job as a SWE.

Your resume will be devoid of something \"on paper\" (like schoolwork or a degree) that shows you actually can do your skills so you have to make it up with your projects and showcased code (or networking).\n\nYou've basically given yourself like 1 month to get a job before starting OMSCS which is not a lot of time unless you are a lot further in the syllabus than I think you are.  From a flat start, it's generally minimum 3 months to get to a good point where your resume would get looked at.\n\nAssuming you don't find a job and start OMSCS:\n\nMaster's program is good on the resume because it shows the career transition.  However the courses you take will not directly contribute to increased job opportunity.  So it eats up time early on that you could spend on learning and display skills that will directly give you a job but has a higher payoff the more you complete your courses.

The way it looked for me was:\n\nI walked into their location with my resume and told them I wanted work.  They had me have an interview with a recruiter who asked me what kind of work I was looking for and my work history, etc etc. I filled out a generic application at this time.   \n\nshe offered me a couple jobs on the spot that weren’t what I was looking for, so, I left that day with nothing.  However, the agency got new jobs every day.  It was her job to watch those jobs and find jobs that fit her candidates.  About a week later she called me and offered me a job that fit what I was looking for. She scheduled an interview between me and the job and I. They offered me the job through the agency.  I performed well at the job, so obviously they found space within the company for me after the 90 days.\n\nThis is my most recent experience with an agency and pretty typical of all my other experiences. \n\n\n—————————-\n\n\nAny time I’ve not had work I got a job within days from a temp agency.  Never once have I let them know I need work and not gotten a job.\n\nI rarely see temp agencies talked about… why is that?  Most jobs end up hiring you on if you are a decent employee so it’s hardly “temporary” in reality.\n\nMy current job is from a temp agency and it’s the best job I’ve ever had.  I live in a town of like 15,000 people and even we have like five temp agencies that *all* have jobs available.\n\nAnything from easy menial busy work to construction to factory work to office jobs.

      "body": "I have applied to a startup company based in the US and they replied back with interest and want to schedule an interview with me. I later looked at their LinkedIn company page again and went to see who's working there. I noticed a pattern. Out of their 50 or so employees on the page, almost all their engineers live in Ukraine or the Balkans. They comprise fewer than 40% of the entire company staff, but almost 100% of the engineering team. Only one engineer is from the local area where I live in the US. And the employees that do live in the greater local area almost all have director or manager roles.\n\nThis isn't my first time around working with a company that's structured like this. In my previous job, 95% of the engineer team lived in India or Pakistan. My managers were mainly cool people to work for, but it was sometimes a hassle to coordinate with people halfway across the globe in bigger projects, and furthermore I have grown to get tired of the job as there was really no future for US developers other than to move into a non-eng. role like management. And also because of the crappy pay. $45k for a salaried worker in the US and $20/hr for independent contractors. Maybe fine for \"baby's first SWE\" job but I could easily do better now.\n\nI have fears that this could turn out the same with the new company. That I can't grow into a lead or architect, unless maybe to lead non-US developers. Nothing against the people from other countries, but I think if a US company structures their staff in this manner- 99% of tech in cheaper foreign countries, non-tech in the US- it will be a disadvantage to any tech people from the US because they won't invest as much on the US side.

If it isn't a core competency and its being contracted out - not so much.\n\nTwo anecdotes.  First, I worked at a large hardware/tech company back in the '00s.  The layoff they had in '09 let go of a good chunk of the internal developers maintaining the ERP system, the website, and the CRM system.  Why?  That wasn't their core competency.  They wanted to focus on the product that they sell, and give some other organization the responsibility of doing things in those systems.\n\nAnother example is Apple's \"tools\" division.  ['Game of Thrones' cold war between contractors plaguing Apple tools division](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/04/07/game-of-thrones-cold-war-between-contractors-plaguing-apple-tools-division).  Apple isn't a company that is focused on internal IT (compare Google or Amazon where maintaining the internal IT systems *is* something that they sell).\n\nSo, having outsourced work for things that don't matter to the company?  Not a major red flag.  Its going to be a mess in part because of the lack of... [hubris](https://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris).\n\nHaving outsourced work for things that *do* matter for the company?  Stay away.\n\nNow, outsourced rather than offshore.  Meh.  They're full time employees.  Other than the timezone and occasional cultural differences, they're full time employees.  Its no different really than a large multinational having offices in other countries... just that this is a small company with an office over there.

That's a huge differentiator and many job filters specifically look for \"PMP.\"\n\n\n\nTailoring tips:\n\n\n\nUse job description keywords: Copy 5–10 key terms from the job ad (e.g., \"stakeholder management,\" \"Agile delivery,\" \"process improvement\") and weave them naturally into your bullets.\n\n\n\nLLM prompt for tailoring: \"Here's my resume \\[paste\\] and a job description \\[paste\\]. Rewrite my experience bullets to emphasize the skills and keywords in the job description, keeping all metrics and outcomes intact. Output in bullet format.\"\n\n\n\nIf you want a targeted rewrite for your top 3 role types, send me a DM with your resume (PDF/Word) and 3 job ads you're focusing on, and I can help you create leaner, ATS-optimized versions with stronger bullets and proper keyword density. You've got the experience — the resume just needs to work harder for you. Good luck!",

      "body": "I'm an IT product manager stuck with a terrible company and terrible boss, so I'm desperately looking for a way out. I've spent the last few months applying to 200+ suitable PM positions on LinkedIn and Indeed and so far only landed ***two*** interviews based on those applications (a few more interviews from recruiters who reached out directly). I made it to the final round for both jobs but was ultimately rejected for whatever reason. My resume is highly polished, I write custom cover letters for all of the positions that I believe are an extremely good fit, and both my LinkedIn and Indeed profiles are also always up to date with very detailed information. For the ones that look like my dream job, I even go the extra mile and reach out to a couple of recruiters from the company on LinkedIn hoping one of them would look at my application. I also have a portfolio on Notion though I doubt most recruiters look at that.\n\nI don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I have CSPO cert, and for many of the positions I literally qualify for every requirement they're asking down to the tech stack the company uses, but my applications all end up in the trash bin. Are most positions on LI and Indeed ghost jobs? Should I work on getting additional certs? Should I be applying on the company site instead? One thing I noticed is many of the jobs I applied to, at least on LinkedIn, ***are constantly being reposted after a few weeks, some of them reposted like 10+ times***, which is definitely suspicious. I know networking is the best way but I'm just a regular person who doesn't know dozens of people in my field who just happen to be hiring for a PM.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention I'm in Canada, and I know the job market here is even worse than the states.",

Hopefully you guys can all use these tips to be successful as well:\n\n- Learn the skills no one else is learning so you can get the opportunities no one else is getting. \n\n- Do something every semester you're in undergrad and graduate school (if you're a student). If you're unemployed, try working on a personal project and use it as a writing sample for future job applications.\n\n- Network, Network, Network. People you know may be leaving positions or have openings within their company/agency. Make sure to be in the loop whenever an opportunity arises.\n\n- Make sure your interviewing skills and resume are on point. You don't want to lose out on opportunities because you can't articulate yourself well or have a terribly formatted resume.\n\n- I disagree with the notion that you have to be lucky to land a job. As long as you show that you're a hard worker, not one to back away from finding new opportunities, and not afraid to learn the hard skills necessary to succeed, you'll find something no matter what! \n\nBest of luck to everyone looking for jobs right now!",

      "title": "6 Offers in 12 Months - My Approach to Job Applications (Entry-Level Corporate)",
      "body": "After reading through some of the recent dispiriting posts on this subreddit, I decided that I'd share my approach to job applications in hopes that it will assist someone out there with any arduous employment challenges that may lay ahead. As a disclaimer, I'm a 23yo bloke who just graduated from University with an Engineering degree with next to no professional experience. The offers that I have received have also all been entry-level positions that are reflective (for the most part) of my experience.\n\nWith 2 month-long internships under my belt, I managed to secure **6 separate job offers** from top-tier companies in **two different fields** (quarter-life crisis career switch) over the past 12 months with, for the most part, an approach that I honed and used throughout all of the separate hiring processes. 4 of these offers were from my previous field, and 2 from my current one.\n\nTo all active job seekers that stumble upon this post - I implore you to think about which elements of this approach may challenge your current strategies and/or what you can tangibly tweak in your approach **that is applicable to you** in my outline.\n\n**Step 1: Application Tracking (and Accountability)**\n\nWhether you're applying for 8 or 800 jobs, you need a tracker to keep on top of your applications. Job hunting is both a *volume* and *quality* game (**more on this later**), so logging key job posting information is critical to retaining visibility and managing the status of your submitted, currently-completing and prospective applications. ^(I really should get sponsored for the countless times I've plugged them), but I use Notion for this as it allows me to quickly customize filters and time-dependent notifications. I've received first-round/digital interviews for 93% of my applications to date - a stat that Notion allows me to track instantly.\n\nDue dates, job posting priority (obviously, prioritize roles you're most interested in), application links, the status of your application and a notes field (to log extra details like employer information session dates) are examples of preliminary information you will want to log in your tracker.\n\nOnce the initial framework for your application tracker is complete, **share a view-only link** with your partner, your best mate, a trusted friend who is also applying for jobs, your dog, John from down the road who always asks how your father is doing - anyone who you know can keep you accountable. If you don't need the gentle nudge, skip this part and march on forward.\n\n**Step 2: Build Your Personal Narrative + Relevant Examples**\n\nAssuming that the roles you're applying for all lie within the same industry, building a personal narrative will allow you to call upon a fundamental story that details how you got to where you are today (i.e. in the position of seeking a new role in the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ field). Think with an *industry* lens when formulating your personal narrative, do not consider specific companies at all here. My personal narrative consists of: my degree, what drove me to pursue that degree including upbringing, a brief rundown of relevant experience to date, what fundamentally excites/motivates me, and hence why this industry would allow me to thrive. Don't just think about it, but put it into words on a page or screen.\n\nNext, have a look at the prior experience that you have (academically and/or professionally), and pinpoint at least 3 examples of situations in which you encountered each of the following (tailor these to your industry):\n\n1. difficulties in a team;\n2. showcased leadership;\n3. exceeded expectations.\n\nYou will want examples that are as multifaceted as possible to be able to use them for a variety of interview questions.\n\nFollowing the above will do two things for you.\n\n1. Off-the-cuff edits you will be making to your CV and cover letters (see Step 4) will flow far more naturally, and you'll be able to churn out consistent material much quicker with a narrative to ground your applications on. There will be no ambiguity when it comes to writing about how you can positively contribute to a company/team.\n2. Subconsciously, you are already gearing up for the interview process. Inevitable questions such as \"Why do you want to work for us?\" and \"Tell me about yourself\" are already answerable with the narrative and examples that you now know back to front.\n\nThese two outcomes are particularly pertinent during the peak interview seasons - I personally had to complete 6 interviews last month in a single week whilst managing FT work, which would've overloaded me with mental fatigue had I not noted down my narrative and examples to the point of them being second nature. Now, let's look at the groundwork required to navigate the widely-used Applicant Tracking Systems and complete CVs and cover letters at scale.\n\n**Step 3: Keywords and Phrases**\n\nBy now, you would have encountered ChatGPT or some other freemium AI chatbot. We're going to be using these chatbots to sieve through job postings and extract keywords and phrases that we will need for our CVs and cover letters in Step 4. Here's what you're going to do.\n\n**a.** Go to your AI chatbot of choice, and get the URL to the job posting in question. Type the following in as a prompt:  \"*I am applying for a job in the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ field. The job ad is here:* [*insert URL here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)*. I am writing a resume and a cover letter tailored to this job posting and require a list of keywords to use. Provide me a list of 15 to use.*\". Go back to your application tracker and create a new field/column next to the relevant job application and store the keyword list there.\n\n**b.** Then, enter the following prompt: \"*Please list out the requirements of the role in dot point form.\".* Repeat the same new field/column step as above.\n\n**c.** Lastly, visit the website of the employer and get the URL. Return to the chatbot and enter the following prompt: \"*This is the company's website:* [*insert URL here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)*. I need to understand a snapshot of what this company is about to tailor my cover letter in a way that shows I can contribute to the company. Please provide me with 10 sentences that highlight what and who this company is. Start with the company's values.*\". Repeat the same new field/column step as above.\n\nArmed with these three new fields, we now turn to the CVs and cover letters themselves.\n\n**Step 4: Build Your CV and Modular Cover Letter**\n\nFirst and foremost, I'm not here to talk about the futility of cover letters in today's hiring process. You need them if you want to stand out (in my experience), so what we'll be focussing on is the adaptation of these two key documents to the specific job and company that each application is targeting.\n\nCV:\n\n* 1 page, newest (and only relevant) experience first, specific achievement outlines, extra-curricular achievements, and ensure references are on a separate document (state it is available upon request).\n* Under your specific achievement outlines, pepper in the keywords that we extracted in Step 3a., ensuring that you tailor your examples to accommodate a natural, unforced tone.\n\nCover Letter:\n\n* Here, we are going to write modular, with the following inclusions and structure:\n   * Intro\n      * Immediately commence with your degree and current position + current project if applicable, noting any prominent achievements to begin with. The aim of the intro is to catch the eye of the employer and to express your desire for the advertised role.\n   * Paragraph 1\n      * This paragraph will be tailored to expressing your personal interest in the company and role itself using the outputs of Step 3c (**in bold below**).\n      * Sentence A: Outline the fact/understanding underpinning your interest in the firm/role. e.g. *As Germany's leading construction contractor for over 35 years, XYZ Corp boasts an* ***unparalleled portfolio*** *of projects that have progressed to define the* ***dynamic infrastructure landscape*** *at a national level, with its ability to deliver* ***consistent value*** *through its team of leading experts being second to none.*\n      * Sentence B: Outline what this means for you. e.g. *As such, this role presents an opportunity for* ***unprecedented professional growth*** *through the* ***unique complexities*** *presented by the firms’ projects under the guidance of* ***industry-leading mentors***\\*, which I am currently seeking in my professional career.\\*\n      * Sentence C: Outline why the firm's workplace is in alignment with your personal narrative.  e.g. *Furthermore, the* ***vibrant workplace*** *underpinning XYZ Corp's* ***people-focused*** *culture represents a unique environment for me to experience and contribute towards dynamic program rotations across the firm’s* ***preeminent suite of assets***\\*.\\*\n   * Paragraph 2\n      * This paragraph will be tailored towards relaying how your experience demonstrates alignment with the requirements divulged in Step 3b (**in bold below**).\n      * Sentence A: Thesis statement for this paragraph, detailing why you fit the role. e.g. *With a strong foundational experience in* ***contract management*** *and* ***design delivery*** *in the* ***public infrastructure sector***\\*, I believe that I am a suitable candidate for the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ position.\\*\n      * Sentences B and C: Outline how you have demonstrated experience for a role requirement and additional room to grow. e.g. *Having fronted several projects in* ***enterprise risk management and sustainability*** *through my current role/academic endeavors at \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, I am seeking to further excel my* ***analytical abilities*** *in* ***understanding, resolving and communicating solutions*** *to strategic issues in* ***complex commercial settings*** *across a diverse array of clientele in Germany's infrastructure landscape.*\n      * Sentence D: Link experience and room to grow to role offerings. e.g. *Coincidingly, I believe XYZ Corp's prowess in delivering* ***data-backed*** *projects through its diverse team of high-calibre engineers presents opportunities to garner unmatched exposure to the* ***project delivery strategies and practices*** *situated at the industry’s forefront.*\n      * Sentence E: Close this paragraph out with how you will further the company's vision (from Step 3c). e.g. *More broadly, I believe that my demonstrated passion for* ***enacting positive and tangible business outcomes*** *is suitably aligned with XYZ Corp's vision to* ***bolster the future through industry-leading personalized training***\\*.\\*\n   * Outro:\n      * Detail your most prominent extra-curricular and educational achievements here, in addition to embellishing with Step 3a. and Step 3c.'s remaining outputs.\n* Ensure your contact details are current and the correct contact is being addressed in the cover letter.\n\n**Step 5: Submit**\n\nAnd you're done! Whilst I would love to go over more interview preparation material, I acknowledge this has turned into quite a chunky post. The above information is a general breakdown of how I went about applying for my roles after being rejected non-stop in the year preceding my graduation year.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n1. Track your applications and share the live list with someone who will keep you accountable (if this helps you).\n2. Write our your personal narrative and some key examples that you can flexibly use in interview scenarios.\n3. AI chatbots to assist with listing out job requirements, company keywords and phrases for your CV and cover letter.\n4. Writing your cover letter with modularity + CV with substitute keywords.\n5. Submit. \n\nHope it helps - feel free to drop a comment below if you have any questions and I'll do my best to address them.\n\nBest of luck with your applications.",

I have asked for feedback from friends, family, other professionally successful people where I might be going wrong in my interview, how I might be coming on in the wrong way, or how I could improve my answers. (I have been doing this as a regular practice, also, for years.) One friend offered that as I'm direct and ambitious, it's *possible* that it's not well received as it would be if a man exhibited the same traits. Accurate or not, this is the only constructive feedback anybody I know has ever offered me. \n\nI'm award-nominated and award-winning in my field. I have diverse experience, over 10 years, including starting my own small-time but successful business (hence why I apply on and off for jobs as I said above). I have great references. Friends, family, even interviewing managers tell me that I'm likable, qualified, competent, capable, talented. \n\nIn an effort to break this long streak of bad luck, I have also: applied to jobs for which I am overqualified, applied to jobs for which I am under-qualified, introduced myself to strangers on LinkedIn, started conversations both online and in-person with strangers whose job trajectories I admire, reached out to places who say they aren't hiring, asked for referrals, used my network to ask around for jobs, started conversations with hiring managers, followed up on old opportunities and relationships. Many result in lovely, pleasant conversations (paired with \"you have everything it takes, I'm not sure why you're not getting hired), but none result in jobs.\n\nI am completely exhausted. I will not give up but I also feel that I have done everything I possibly can, and have no notion that I will eventually break this streak.\n\nMeanwhile, I know a 23-year-old who has a degree in an irrelevant field, does not speak the first language of my country, and just got offered a job for a mid-level career at a multi-national corporation, where she has great pay and job security for life if she wants it. She applied on a whim.\n\nThere is clearly something that people who are getting offered jobs - something they do or that they are, that I am not. **What is it?**\n\nIf I seem desperate and bitter, it's only because I am. I'm hoping for any insights or perspective on what people getting offered jobs do or have. Thanks in advance.",

I went through the same thing recently when I really wanted feedback and it wasn’t forthcoming. I’ve accepted that in most cases people don’t give helpful feedback for a lot of reasons. This can be really frustrating and may cause undue anxiety to creep into your interview performance. \n\nTry chilling out a bit. Also I know it’s difficult but stop comparing your progress to others you know who are searching and seem to be having a better time than you. It doesn’t make you feel any better and who knows what lengths they’ve gone to or struggles they’ve had to overcome unbeknownst to you, to get the success you also want. Concentrate on your progress. \n\nThis helped me and may help you… \n\n[copy pasted from my previous response to a similar question today]\n\nI began applying a couple of months back after a 1 year career break. I started to get worried because I wasn’t receiving any interview offers so I ensured I kept updating my CV and LinkedIn profile to improve my prospects. I put in a lot of effort but in doing without managing my expectations and perspectives I inadvertently introduced stress and anxiety to my search.\n\nWhen I got an interview I was extremely anxious. I got an offer but it wasn’t what I wanted. Like you I felt I connected with the people I interviewed with. A friend advised me to stop overthinking things, over practising question responses and just have a conversation with the interviewer. So I read the job description a few times and then forgot about the interview for a couple of days. Carried on applying and just concentrating on being more relaxed. Had the interview. Treated it as a conversation. Even said “I can’t say I know the answer to this question because I don’t know your process etc but bearing this in mind, here’s how I’d approach the situation.”  I LISTENED to the interviewer, slowed down and responded appropriately. I realised I can’t do this effectively when I’m anxious about impressing them.\n\nGot a second interview - slightly surprised because I had never gone into an interview with so little preparation but it made sense. Like you I’d practiced and prepared and prepared. There comes a time when you have to stop and be confident you’ve done enough. They asked me to give a presentation - I delivered (they said it was extraordinary - and got the job.\n\nI am absolutely convinced that when I’m overly anxious and focused on being “impressive” I put people off on some level. They like me but the energy (powered by the underlying emotion, fear) is too much - I come off as too intense. 🤦‍♀️\n\nConsider trying this. You’ve nothing to lose.",

I'm just not sure it helps to say, \"but it wouldn't happen to a man,\" absent more data. \n\nFor instance, my spouse worked with men who's personalities just weren't a good fit for the group.

They prefer history in similarly sized, or slightly smaller companies. Working im a big company is very different from working in a small company: depending on the field &amp; role the role itself mighhr differ (be smaller in scope), stakeholder management and cross-team collaboration might be important, etc. It’s easier to hire someone with that experience\n- Your young friend probably got a more junior role? It’s easier for her to enter the business closer to entry level roles. You, though, on paper should have the qualifications - but they might have an asterisk\n- Being too direct and ambitious cn be offputting in both men and women. If I’m hiring for a role I’m hiring for that role, and it’s important for me to find candidate who is interested in thag role instead of seeing it as an immediate stepping stone to a promotion. Of course people have plans. But you should be comfortable with that role fpr a year or two.\n- Direct can mean a lot of things. You need to come off faiely likeable. You can be direct in questions.\n- Award-winning is great, but it’s something that I wouldn’t focus on too much. Any designer (my field) worth their salt has won a bunch of awards. You typically decorate the office bathroom wall with them. Once you’ve won a few you can stop stressing about them, and keep that as byline im your cv.\n\nFew pointers that could be, or not be, helpful:\n- Apply to less roles but better\n- Investigate the company &amp; role beforehand. Make sure you understand the company’s trajectory, short term &amp; long term strategy, how the role contributes to that\n- Always have a list of insightgul questions preppes. Try to focus on the most strtegic points you can\n\nMost importantly:\n- You can ask at the end of an interview this: What is your perfect candidate for this role like?\n- To talent acquisitiom (and head hunters if you are talking with any) you can ask: What are the gaps you see in my profile vs. this role you are looking for?\n- Either of those questions tell you what they are actually looking for.

I’ve been looking for a new job for quite sometime now since my current company no longer aligns with my interests well in terms of salary, scaling down on benefits, changing in terms of culture, etc.\n\nMy general experience here was great for the first year or so and I loved my job scope, my boss and my team. My boss then decides to move teams and I’m stuck with this new boss (K) who I thought I worked well with but later on realised he barely sticks up for the team and just made sure his own ass was covered. At the same time, we go through a restructure and I’m now leading 2 teams with different scopes instead of 1 which I was doing before.\n\nOur performance review comes along and I ask my stakeholders for feedback including one manager, Y, I worked a couple of times with before. She’s quite influential even though nobody but upper management really likes working with her since she provides results. In one project, I missed cascading a piece of information to the rest of the team. She discovers it, creates a group chat with K, K’s boss (A) and I, and proceeds to express her major disappointment. I apologise, fix it and thought it as resolved (it didn’t have any financial impact or anything). Nope. She mentions it on my performance review and deems me an underperforming team lead and suggests very strongly I go on PIP. I get a low rating. I try justifying against it with K, “what about my achievements and positive feedback from other stakeholders?”, who didn’t seem to fight for me and says ratings are heavily impacted by someone on Y’s level. I even brought it up with Y herself who tells me that stakeholder feedback doesn’t matter as much as my working relationship with my boss who apparently is responsible for my rating. K indirectly blames Y. Y indirectly blames K. And I’m bearing the brunt of it. In retrospect, it was probably a bad idea to have asked Y for feedback, but I thought some other things I worked on with her went well (ironically, for the positive section of the review, she “didn’t work closely enough” with me to give feedback). \n\nFast forward to a few months later where we undergo another restructure, my boss K resigns, my role changes, and I’m placed under  a new boss, B. B reports to Y. Y very heavily pushes B to put me into PIP, even brings HR into it, but B (bless his soul; one of the best bosses to date) pushes back and stands up for me. They compromise and I’m placed under an unofficial PIP where we work out 3 main goals as a guideline and use that to prove I don’t deserve to be under PIP. Along the way, I work more closely with Y and she deems I’m good enough and stops picking on me for every little thing.\n\nI find out from my boss, B, that Y had a number of preconceived notions about me, including one where I constantly questioned K why we did certain things despite it not being in our scope and that by my doing so, I didn’t fit into the company culture of going “above and beyond”. True, I questioned things because I wanted to identify gaps and reduce the workload from my team, but always ended up doing it anyway. Was questioning wrong, now? I was under the impression K shared the same sentiments as I did since we agreed sometimes and I never would’ve thought he’d betray me by sharing these 1-1 conversations.\n\nApparently, K also portrayed to HR that I claimed some benefits (overtime meals) more than anyone else. Funnily enough, K was the one who told me about my colleague in a diff country who reported to him and claimed everyday. I was following in that colleague’s steps since I often worked overtime, and K always approved my claims so why is it that my reputation is being tarnished here? HR now has this negative impression of me because of it. So much for HR being fair/impartial. I know this because one time, HR asked B and when B said I didn’t claim anything for a project, HR was surprised. \n\nSo K created all this drama, makes me look bad and I suffer from its consequences. \n\nQuestion is, should I somewhat attempt to clear the air with HR during my exit interview? Is it even worth it to, and possibly affect my reputation even more? If I do, how do I do so without implicating B since he shared all this with me? Or shall I just pretend everything is rosy and leave on a good note?",

Does my parent care that I’m hurting and don’t know what to do(absolutely not, she only cares how me not going to school will negatively affect her)? I was put on medication that made me feel numb and I still didn’t want to go to school. Over time, I still went to college and grad school but I’m still numb and I’m over it.

My boss even ignored me on my last day and hasn't spoken to me since - she did the same to my coworker who was let go alongside me but I suppose it didn't help that my intermittent crying and occasional morose energy deterred her.\n\n  \nDuring the following 15 months, I applied relentlessly - LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, Dice, Swooped, etc. I came across ghost jobs, almost got scammed a few times (the job posting I applied for set up a scammy Teams interview then I got an immediate offer without ever meeting anyone or doing further assessments, they're rife out there), and even had some employers audaciously ask me for comprehensive work they could use to their benefit - I have another post in this sub documenting what they wanted me to do. There were days where I got so close like going through six interviews for a job I was hoping for, that I knew would fit me like a glove and I would be happy, only to get the dreaded auto-rejection email with no further explanation. Days I felt useless and rejected personally, struggling with the notion that I wouldn't be able to afford Christmas presents or bills in the wake of all this (for me, giving Christmas gifts to my loved ones brings me such joy that I felt embarrassed I couldn't give them what I wanted to get them).\n\nFinally, after meeting with five different people and going through at least four interviews, I landed a job in MarComm building a marketing program for a smaller arm of a larger organization. Benefits/PTO are decent and work-life balance is insisted upon. They told me upon my offer that one of the biggest reasons to them choosing me was how determined I was to get to the bottom of things, how I was able to work cross-functionally, and my resourcefulness. And while there is a lot of work to be done here in my new role and many people wear multiple hats, I am thankful for getting an opportunity within my line of work, especially given how MarComm is so problematic in terms of finding job security at present. \n\n  \nOverall, I want to tell you all that some days were bleaker than others but I'm supremely thankful to have been given this opportunity and hope the same for every one on this sub who is going through something similar as I have done through this past year. It is a tough road and so I hope my post can bring a bit of hope to those who have been struggling. Granted, I know there are many who have to take what they can get in this economy to make ends meet but I would like to tell you things can and do change, to please not give up hope, and to keep fighting.",

      "body": "Hi all! No right or wrong answer here as I understand it is not possible to know but curious about what your gut would tell you, I am just trying to keep a very good pulse on what's going on around me so I make the right choice. I was laid off out of nowhere a few days over a week ago. I've had the incredible fortune of landing an offer since, a lot of it luck in that I applied for a job at a firm that's really small and I was a good fit and the timing just worked in my favor. That said, it's a pretty steep pay cut  (25%) for me, and I really applied to it as a fingers crossed safety net. Have dealt with some ghost jobs in the interim, so I'm very spooked about the idea of passing on a real offer. That said, a new, interesting company that looks fairly small as well, that I've done some due diligence on and feel a bit better is not a ghost job (everything matches up, the job posting is both on LinkedIn as well as the company's actual website, actually detailed job description, applied when it was about 2 weeks old, etc.) reached out to me the day before I got my offer, and I've scheduled the first interview (seems to be a longer interview that's on a video call and more than a phone screen).\n\nThe thing is, I applied, and had my application viewed and resume downloaded the same day I applied. However, almost a full week passed with nothing after that, so I thought, OK, they just decided nah, we changed on our mind on this applicant. No big deal. After that week passed, though, they invited me to interview.\n\nMy questions are the following -- could that timing between my resume being downloaded and them contacting me give me any clues as to whether or not I'm a serious candidate? For instance, maybe they were already underway with other candidates that week and have purely reached out to me to have a candidate in case none of them take the offer for one reason or another? Or, I could be completely overthinking and over-analyzing it as it could be as simple as they put recruiting on the side for a few days? sorry this ended up being long, I am just under intense pressure trying to balance an interest in my next job vs. the need to have an income, and am deeply worried about the idea of not taking an offer I have on the table. Any opinions at all are appreciated - thank you!\n\nedit: if this detail matters, this is in Canada. Although I'm sure whatever is going on applies in the United States too.",

      "body": "So I recently got a job at a gas station that I guess I won’t name. The work is simple I’m extremely experienced in these kinds of jobs and the people are nice. All fine in that area. \n\nWhen I interviewed I told them I have an open schedule. I applied part time, they asked me if part time hours were okay or if I wanted more. I emphasized PART TIME. I have two kids 11 and 17 and I am married. A lot goes into scheduling around them. \n\nI started Monday and was annoyed right off the bat I wasn’t given a schedule. I came in and worked eight hours Monday to have my manager whisper in my ear to show up the following day same time. Less than 24 hour notice. I was annoyed but figured I’m training whatever. I then got my schedule on Tuesday and they explained their schedules were done from Friday being the first day of the week through Thursday’s. Okay. They had verbally told me this week on Tuesday that I would be working Mon-Thurs so I assumed great I have the weekend off. Nope. Saturday and Sunday are on a different “week”. I then start hearing the other employees chattering about how their schedules were done so early this week! It was done Tuesday for Friday. What?! Less than a weeks notice and they thought it was early! So now even though wanting to work part time I’m working a full forty hours between Mon-Sat. with this notion that I’ll never be able to plan my life due to scheduling being given out in less than a week’s advance. \n\nI wrote this out and am considering sending it to the two managers once I get to work and get their phone numbers. Do I sound entitled? \n\nHello, hope all is well! \n\nI just thought it best I have a conversation about this right away versus waiting to say something. When I said I had an open schedule for work hours it was under the assumption that I would know at least a week in advance what those hours are. Unfortunately, the way the work week is scheduled (Friday -Thursday) not having the schedule a week in advance adds extra complications. I have a family I need to schedule around and not knowing which days I’ll be working simply will not work for me and my family. \n\nI also emphasized I wanted part time hours. I said that under the assumption that you guys defined part time as other companies I have worked for being under 30 hours a week. I really am not willing to work anymore than 24 hours a week. \n\nI also asked (temporary manager training for a different store)  if we rotate weekends. I wrongly assumed that since I wasn’t asked if I was okay with working every weekend that we would be on rotations. I am only willing to work every other weekend if weekends are where you need me. \n\nI understand that it’s hard to juggle schedules and I just wanted to communicate right away where my boundaries are so that I don’t put myself into a position to be depended on more than what I’m willing to give. \n\nI would love to continue working for (name of gas station.)  The staff is extremely kind and I’m very experienced in this type of setting so the work comes easy! However, if you are not able to either give me a week in advance schedule notice, set weekend rotations I can plan around, and/or give me set work days unfortunately I will have to respectfully decline the job. \n\n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\nI should also mention I took starting pay wage. I have six years of management experience. I work simple jobs like these so I don’t get stuck with three to four weekend days a month, full time, and unexpected hours. I really don’t feel like getting paid scratch for a frustrating schedule. If I wanted that I’d find something that pays more.",

This percentage amounts only to the number of people that due to my visa are able to make it through to finally join the USA job market, which is a whole other beast in itself.\n\n(THIS IS NOT TO BRAG, although I am proud of myself for landing this job I shared this info in the hope to give those who read this post a bit of perspective, if an idiot like me with a shit GPA and with little to no odds to work in the us at ALL managed to land a FAANG job you can easily find a job for yourself)\n\nI divided the whole process in tranches of 2 weeks each where I would add something or fix something to see If it would increase my odds off getting an interview.\n\n**Tools utilized**:  \n\\-***Notion***(free version, utilized the template “Job Applications” to track the application process(the template is free as well).\n\n\\-***Calendar*** to structure a schedule that would allow me to keep up with the quantity of applications.\n\n**Format:** Google “Harvard Resume Template”\n\nLETS START:\n\n**1st TRANCHE Week 1-2 | START.**\n\n**STRATEGY**:Same Resume-Cover letter, created a template for the cover letter that I would fill in, paid an expert to optimize the template as well as proofread my resume template.\n\n**RESULT:** **140 Applications = 84 Rejected 56 No Answer**\n\n**2nd TRANCHE Week 3-4 | INTRODUCTION TO AI - 1st Interview - Getting Extra Certifications.**\n\n\\-Started to take a look at forums and reddit asked opinions, implemented AI.\n\n\\-Obtained free certifications for the following: SQL, Excel, Google Analytics.

Structured my day in a different way to I would have resume and cover letter prepared (which is 80-90% to the application process) using the calendar was HUGE in helping me structuring my time more efficiently. This was grueling and non sustainable I do not suggest to to this, but ultimately It was helpful because it led me to my last idea which was the one that made me succeed.\n\n**5th TRANCHE Weeks 9-14 THE FINAL RECIPE - PAID AN EXPERT TO APPLY FOR ME I CRACKED THE CODE**\n\nExpectedly got really busy with school again, knowing that I decided to talk with the person who gave me lesson and would proof read my stuff and asked if he would apply for me, and do the whole process for me(applications only no interview). Negotiate ad price and did the deal, it was far from cheap and considerably more expensive than the most expensive “expert” on freelance sites.\n\n**RESULT:**\n\n**9-10 140 Applications = 105 Rejected 24 No Answer** ***•11 First Interview•***\n\n\\*\\*11-12 140 Applications = 93 Rejected 39 No Answer •\\*\\****8 First Interview•***\n\n**13-14 140 Applications = 82 Rejected 45 No Answer** •***13 First Interview•***\n\nPersonal Reflection: This was the most expensive by a long shot overall, but it came back paying in spades. Also for clarity I negotiated a bulk price for a number of applications amount/week, I had to pay NO percentage of my employment rate.\n\n**TLTR and CRUDE TIPS:**  \n\\-tailor each applications to the job.\n\n\\-schedule your applications time to stay on top of it.\n\n\\-all of the ai apps around might help but wont really automate anything or make you save too much time to be worth it.\n\n\\-stay away from freelance that offer to apply for you for cheap.\n\n\\-hire someone knowledgable someone that necessarily doesn't offer the service of applying for you and try to negotiate with them a way to do so, is gonna be worth your money.",

      "body": "As a software engineer with about two decades of experience I thought I have seen it all, ranging from a plush animal stolen from my cubicle to higher-ups bragging about getting banned from an ad platform for clickfarming.  Once I've even exchanged rings with the founder of a startup I was working at.  This last one is not as spicy as it sounds though -- he designs puzzle rings as a hobby.\n\nPlease bear with me if the following reads like a paranoid rant.  Paranoia is a requirement of my profession -- whether it involves ensuring a messaging application is cryptographically secure, or that web services don't fall over costing potential millions and making the company lose face -- and not the result of emotional trauma inflicted by an ex.\n\nIt all started on October 17th when a representative of The Staffing Agency reached out to me on LinkedIn on behalf of their client, The Big Tech Firm In The Silicon Valley That You've Certainly Heard Of.  They needed someone with \"good experience in Developing Python and C++ from Scratch\" (???) and I would \"be well compensated\".  I'm well-versed in both so I figure I could be their unicorn, especially if it's onsite.  I schedule a call and we discuss the role a bit -- which ends up in fact being an onsite contract -- though he has no further technical details to offer.  The subject of compensation comes up and after I inform him of my prior base pay he tells me that The Firm pays better than that.  \"Well, you sketchy enjoyer of mothers,\" I think, \"promising me the Moon right off the bat.\"  I let it slide for now and we decide to proceed with the interviews, though I have to ask them to never cold-call me and always communicate through text or email in the future -- a truly inscrutable notion.\n\nThe introductory, nontechnical call with a manager goes well and I get scheduled to speak with a couple of engineers for 90 minutes.  One day prior I get an email with the job description -- scant on technical details like the software stacks, but offering work on \"many multifaceted projects\".  As a generalist, I figure I can pass the technical interview in Python and excuse myself for being a bit rusty in C++ given that I haven't used it in over 4 years.  The interview comes along and I'm greeted with coderpad.  Compiler?  GCC.  Confused, I ask if I'm interviewing for the hybrid Python and C++ role.  They also appear confused, and inform me that this is a purely C++ position.  Everyone's confused! and, personally, I'm flustered even -- at being put on the spot like that.  I decide to make the best of the situation and plow through knowing that I'll have to look up how do to basic shit like file input/output while under scrutiny.  At some point through the first challenge I try to do something clever with variadic functions but draw a blank that I actually want variadic *template* functions instead, so after much ado in the weeds I finally end up solving it in the most straightforward way possible, and after a little debugging it just works.  And all it took me was 50 minutes instead of the 5 it would in Python.\n\nI'm morally preparing myself for the second, harder challenge -- as that's how I typically conduct my interviews -- when one of the interviewers asks... \"Do you like puzzles?\"  I roll my eyes and sigh \"not really\".  We're about to burn ropes and weigh coins and shit.  After the remaining 40 minutes of the interview is spent burning ropes and weighing coins the interview concludes, leaving me sitting there wondering what the hell just happened.  I ultimately decide not to worry about it too much.  Yet.\n\nEarly evening rolls around and I get a text from Sketchy (as I'll call him from now on) asking me how the interview went and wishing me a good morning.  Taking that in stride I fill him in and that's that for now.  It's a Friday and I don't expect anything definitive until next week.  Monday comes along and I get a text message to call him, which I do, and well what do you know?  They wish to extend me an offer!  There is another person on the call who I presume to be Sketchy's manager filling me in on the details.  Eventually she gets to the actual hourly rate she has in front of her and I resist the urge to check whether I've taken my Math degree off my resume, as not even accounting for inflation it would be below the base salary I've had 3 years ago, at a startup, where the main draw would have been the stock options.  At such a rate I would expect to grow some ever-expanding copypasta and wrangle with brilliantly unorthodox variable naming conventions meant to maximize job security.\n\nSomehow during her spiel the rate gets lower leaving me wondering what I'll even be getting paid in that fluctuates so quickly.  Bitcoin, or possibly Tether?  Near the end she catches herself and reverts to the previous deeply insulting rate and we have a good long laugh about the gaffe.  At this stage I'm wondering if there's even any point in negotiating with these imbeciles.  Sure I could try to haggle it up a couple of bucks, and we can all feel proud about what a tough negotiator I am, but that was literally the only technical interview I've gotten since July and they probably think they have me by the ba-- I mean the economy is doing great and nobody wants to work!  Cynically, I figure my best course of action would be to accept the offer and continue looking for work while having The Firm as my current place of employment.  Normally I wouldn't even contemplate doing something so underhanded, but considering the levels of contempt, I feel entirely guilt-free.  I accept the offer, they are very thrilled about it, and I pretend to be entirely stoked about working at The Firm.  They then inform me that they will send me a verbal offer letter email -- **klaxons blaring in my head** \\-- and then do the background check once I confirm my employment.\n\nFor the uninitiated, there is not -- nor has there ever been -- such a thing as a *verbal offer letter email*.  There is a verbal offer, which is what was being discussed, which I have accepted, and which is legally completely non-binding though it may be considered rude to break depending on circumstances -- I had one rescinded right when the pandemic lockdowns have started and would not blame the other party.  Then there's the written offer, which involves the employer sending you an offer already signed by them, which you then also sign, make a copy, and send it back.  This kind of offer is generally written to be contingent on the background check passing so there's no obligation of employment in case a candidate fails to disclose anything shady in their past, and even in at-will employment states like California there may be legal ramifications for breaking such a contract.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, the only practical reason for an employer to foot the bill for a background check without a legally binding offer is if they think they can bait candidates with their \"verbal\" offers into thinking that they have *actual* offers while having The Firm interview candidates The Agency can lowball even further.  After all, there's a lot of fish in the sea, why not keep fishing for an even bigger one?  They can then give a proper offer to the lowest bidder and pocket the difference, with $40 or so per background check just being the cost of doing business.  At this point every fiber of my being is screaming at me that I'm getting scammed, but we wish each other a good rest of the day and hang up.  I am to start work the Monday after Thanksgiving, almost 3 weeks from today.\n\nBefore doing anything else, I wait for their \"verbal\" offer just to see what they think that looks like.  Sketchy's manager-apparent, who ends up having a much fancier title, sends it to me two days later and it so turns out that a \"verbal\" offer is just a list of colon-separated name-value pairs -- e.g. \"Work Hours: 9am - 6pm\" and yes that was in there -- telling me informative things such as the pay rate and which city I'd be working in.  For some reason the offer is prefaced with a \"Congratulation on your offer\".  I feel a bit cheated for only receiving a single congratulation, but I suppose it's fair as nobody else in their right mind would profess any more of them for a mere \"verbal\" offer.  Perhaps this woman -- let's call her Jiàndié -- comes from some kind of country where they don't have plurals?  Anything is possible at this point.\n\nAfter consenting to the whatever that was, I decide it's time to sit down and try to figure out who these clowns are.  First I pull up the source of the interview invitation email and do a `whois` on the original IP address.  That checks out, so at least my interviews were scheduled by someone actually at The Firm.  Next I look up The Agency to find out that it's located in the very same county as The Firm.  It is very strange, then, that their representative(s) would appear to not know or care about: The Firm's timezone; the job role's technical requirements; The Firm's compensation rates; how job offers work.  I look Sketchy up and turns out he's in the Philippines.  Well, that explains one of the discrepancies though it doesn't excuse it.  Meanwhile, the background check website is asking me for my SSN.  This really doesn't sit well with me, but they seem like a major provider, so I fill out the form and hope my identity doesn't get stolen.  There's nothing to do but wait now.\n\nJust under a week passes, and my offer letter comes in!  Almost had you there for a moment didn't I?  What I actually get is an invitation to log into a staffing portal where I can fill out and sign an entire wastebasketful of forms including the offer letter.  I make time to go through some of the paperwork the following day -- most notably find the offer and sign it just to get that out of the way.  Avoiding anything financial for now -- subconsciously my heart is really not in it -- I continue filling out and signing some of the more trivial stuff, being unable to help but notice how the paperwork is frequently irrelevant if not downright nonsensical.  Among the forms consenting to be drug tested and not being tardy (???), I have to sign waivers for non-exempt employees regarding lunch and work breaks, in one case even having to sign the waiver and the revocation of that very same waiver within the same document.  The laughable rate I'm at is still above California's standards, and the offer letter was explicitly titled \"Exempt Offer Letter\", so none of that particular paperwork even applies to me and is a complete waste of time.  I decide I'm done for now and will fill out the rest closer to the start date.\n\nNothing happens for another week or so, but on Tuesday before Thanksgiving I get a text wishing me a good morning in the afternoon -- I'm used to this by now -- and asking me to undergo onboarding.  That same day I tell them I can show up Monday wherever, ideally not too early.  Afternoon on the following day -- Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the long weekend -- they inform me that it's not for The Firm but for them and ask if I can do so later today.  At this point I'm questioning their lack of planning but within twenty minutes I reply asking if they wish to do so in the next hour or so.  After a couple of hours of not getting a reply I ask if they can schedule something through email, and once more get nothing in return.\n\nAt this point I feel fairly bummed.  Thanksgiving comes and goes.  On Friday I attempt to fill out the rest of the paperwork, but run into a bit of a snag -- I can't log in.  Surely I must have forgotten my password. .......Right.  I try to reset it, twice, no such luck.  It would appear that the contract that I've signed has gone *unilateral*.  I'm shocked. Shocked! Well, not that shocked.  I'd call them but since the Philippines and the country that oughtn't be inquired about haven't reached out to me at all so far, Happy Thanksgiving to the both of them!\n\nThe weekend comes, I do laundry in vain anticipation that I'll have an actual workweek and won't have time to otherwise.  On Monday, still having heard nothing and now feeling like for the first time in my entire professional career I'm a no-show on the first day, I call up an acquaintance at The Firm and try to figure out what's going on.  They tell me they'll check, and get back to me.  Close to 8 PM they tell me that apparently I start work tomorrow...  Still nothing from The Agency, outside of apparently having been signed up for some mandatory training by a third party.  I make dinner around 9, check my email after, yet more nothing.  At this point I'm thinking screw it, so I just hang out online with friends til about 2 AM and try not to think about it.\n\nI decide to check my email one last time before I shower and go to bed and lo and behold!  Turns out I got an email at 10:19 PM from Jiàndié titled \"First Day Instruction\".  Well, at least there's only one instruction.  She \"needs\" me to go somewhere tomorrow before 10:30 AM to get a badge, and then go to Some Acronym building to report to my manager.  OK, that's actually two.  Furthermore, the email is using creative capitalization and various spellings of the word \"you\", and the best part is it's replying to my consent of the \"verbal\" offer letter with the stipulated start date of today.  I'm experiencing a mix of amusement and growing outrage I haven't felt the like of since my ex.  This fish is really getting its chain yanked.  Being too angry to respond I decide to just go to bed for now, but for obvious reasons can't fall asleep until about 7 AM.\n\nAt 9 AM I am awoken by a phone call probably from The Agency that I don't even bother with.  At this stage I'm feeling pretty beat as well as being completely out of any f---s to give.  At 10:07 AM I receive a text repeating the instruction of where I have to be in under 23 minutes from now, and that they can schedule onboarding sometime this week.  I make myself breakfast, sit down, and reply to Jiàndié -- CC-ing Sketchy -- that to the best of my knowledge I have no contract with them, please do not contact me any further, and have a nice day.  She immediately responds asking if I talked to Sketchy and whether I got another job.  And this is the story of how I fired a Big Tech firm on my first day, though they likely think I threw a tantrum and ragequit over a scheduling mistake.\n\nThe cherry on top is that even as I'm editing this on December 10th, I'm still receiving daily email reminders to complete some mandatory training on how to safely browse the web.",

      "title": "Escaping a toxic environment and new directions",
      "body": "TL/dr: Trying to escape a toxic work environment, not sure where to go from here, think age may be working against me.\n\nI (49M) have a liberal arts degree which I've almost never used in its field of study. My life is pretty simple. Just me and a pet. I do have a mortgage and the bills that come along with home ownership, but no car payment. I have some savings, but not enough to allow me to quit my job to go back to school full-time.\n\nI've been working the same job at an insurance company for around nine years and make a little over $50k. I was glad to get the job because I went through some tough times professionally and am still glad to have it. But the job has changed. Ever since the whole office went to remote work back in 2020, the company can't stop implementing increasingly ridiculous policies. My manager at the time got a promotion, and it became an example of someone failing up. They were ok at their previous level, but they're now in way over their head. The micromanagement is just about intolerable, the manager thinks it's good to pit the older and newer employees against each other, and we spend more time tracking our work tasks than actually doing them. I think it shows that most of the so-called company leadership is inept and out of touch. It's like the movie \"Office Space\" with the TPS reports, only worse... I get threatened with termination at least once per month because I don't play the stupid game very well. My friends and colleagues at other companies have assured me that things aren't this bad where they work, and I want to believe them. But you hear enough bad stories, plus getting dispirited by your own experiences... I keep wishing for a significant backlash against these companies who do stupid stuff like this, but it hasn't happened yet.\n\nI've had some interviews at other companies, and some have gone to the second level. But none of them have generated a job. I can't help but think that my age is working against me. Also, I didn't intend to stay in the same job the whole time I was with my current company, but none of my internal interviews went anywhere. So, while staying at the same company may have been good, not getting new jobs or promotions may also be a negative factor.\n\nAll this makes me wonder if finding a job at another company might be just jumping from one frying pan into another. The notion of having to do that until I somehow manage to make it to retirement age is so dispiriting... I feel like I should be making more money at this point in life, and I'm not anti-work or trying to shirk responsibility. I just want to escape the increasingly toxic atmosphere in my current job. I'm not lazy, but I'm also not interested in getting caught up in some 60 hour/week hustle. Just because I don't have a family doesn't mean I've got nothing better to do than work all the time.\n\nI've thought about going into the trades or learning to weld and getting certified, at least as a means of having a fallback option, though I'm not sure about the money. The IT field has its own appeal, though many stories these days seem to highlight how there's a contraction taking place there. I'm the kind of person who enjoys knowing how things work. Taking stuff apart and trying to get it back together again. I enjoy working on cars and motorcycles, bicycles... I really enjoy working on old watches and clocks. I learned a few things from a watchmaker years ago, and it's quite a fun hobby. But I'm not equipped to do it professionally. That would require more tools and training. Not against the idea, but no place near me offers training. Not too many places in the US offer it even though it's a field where the demand for qualified employees is high. Most people I know in the automotive maintenance  field say that it's hard to make any money unless they work in a high-end import shop. The average dealership service shop tends to be a flat-rate grindhouse and will likely get more so since they claim to be short on qualified employees. I have an old friend who works in the service department at a BMW dealer in another city. He breaks six figures and enjoys the job, but he told me that's not the norm and not to expect that anywhere without some kind of specialized training.\n\nNot against going into the trades, but also wonder how my age could be a factor there. I've done sales in the past but found it to be a bad fit, my last retail experience was over 20 years ago, and I would like to keep it that way. I've never just worked for myself. I'm open-minded about change, but feel stuck and am not sure what the next step is. I know my situation isn't like some people where they basically have to eat shizzle sandwiches all the time to keep their families fed.\n\nAny thoughts or ideas? TYIA.",

      "title": "I used Chat GPT 4.5 Voice as my Mock Interviewer. Passed all 5 Interviews including the last one with the VP. Obtained job offer and currently in onboarding.",
      "body": "Edit: I am using the $20 subscription version of GPT not the free version. I have also used the $200 version with Operator which is actionable and can go out and build you a website, create a notion workspace and other things. However, the $20 is more than enough.  I just use the $20 then upgrade for a month to the $200 use its tools for what I need then revert back to the $20 subscription. I don't think you need the $200 version unless you were starting your own online business which I am also in the process of doing because I want to escape the corporate matrix eventually. Also, you can create a project folder in Chat GPT and title it \"Interview Prep\" then within that folder you create a new chat with GPT related to only your interview materials. That way it stays in one place and tell GPT to activate persistent memory within that project and keep all your interactions related to that in the \"Interview Prep\" Project folder.\n\nOpened a new chat and gave the GPT a prompt that it was a professional HR Interviewer and will be interviewing me for \\[insert role\\] . GPT already had my Resume and Cover letter since....it wrote it lol. So I provided other work histories as well as the Job description and company website so that it would have enough background to question me accordingly. Told it to lay out the interview process based on everything it can find on the company and forums/discussions. It laid out the process and probabilities then came the questioning. I activated voice mode and then instructed it to start the mock interview initial with HR. It produces multiple questions and as I would answer it would critique and provide me with more refined improved answers. This was extremely helpful and when it came time for the first HR interview the questions were almost identical. I breezed through that one.\n\nNext interview was with 3 managers, I got their names from the HR email that arranged the meeting via teams. Had Chat GPT active search each by name to obtain further information. Once done I had it tailor questions for the interview and provide a mock interview based on the situation. Being a second interview and with 3 managers, GPT tailored the questions accordingly based on the phase I was in within the interview process. It would also switch between 3 personalities and question types, each one taking a turn to ask questions. It was as if I was in an actual interview. However feedback is given after every answer and you are able to answer again post feedback to work on your delivery.  That interview was successful and some questions were familiar just worded different.\n\nThe next 2 interviews were with 2 directors on different days. I followed the same process above and both went great! Questions seemed on par almost as if they all just get questions from some HR pool or something.\n\nThe final interview was with the VP. Now this one was different as GPT stated the question answer approach will need to change. Due to the phase of the interview process these questions will be different in scope. So I went along with GPTs guidance. The questions it asked and feedback it gave were the saving grace. I do not think I would have been in that mindset for those questions. I was able to get through several tough ones due to how GPT had trained me to answer.\n\nAll in all, I think people should leverage this to their advantage with regards to the overall job hunt and process.\n\nWith GPTs help I aced the interview process, was able to be selected over the competition based on my answers and delivery.\n\nI have now accepted a position and am in orientation. Best of Luck to all!\n\nSide Note: The Job market is in disarray with ghost jobs because organizations are in the process of rolling out AI and Robotic Process Automation. I am in the process of onboarding and orientation but I have no clue how long I will have the new job. My old job automated me out. In that time I have been upskilling with using AI and getting familiar with various AIs as well as AI agents. You do not need to be a developer. Try your hand at experimenting with Chat GPT. Ask it to provide you with a list of 10 business you can start at home with zero tech skills and zero capitol. Tell it that you do not want to hold product and that you want to create a business with low to no overhead and leverage AI. Also tell it you want to sell digital products. Then it will provide a list. When you get stuck copy and past into the chat and tell it to guide you. If you cannot secure a position with a company then carve your own path.\n\nWe live in a time where anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can leverage AI and create a business. It will be hard at first and will require discipline. But once you work past that and are successful and everything is in place you may be better off. You will fail, that is part of he process the main thing is to get up and keep trying.\n\nTry it out and see what Ideas AI comes up with for you. You would be surprised. There is a technological industrial revolution occurring. In the first wave those who do not leverage AI will lose their jobs to those who are.\n\nSecond wave, well lots of cuts. So it could be beneficial to learn now. Before the waves of unemployed start to enter the search as the mass layoffs are already here.\n\nRemember. YOU CAN DO IT. It depends on how bad you want it and how much time you are willing to put forth. There will be long nights and early mornings. But anything that is of quality and worth will take work.\n\nWork for yourself and grind and be your own boss. Or work for someone else. The choice is yours and in this day you have access to an abondance of information and AI. If you get stuck ask AI to literally hand hold and guide you. If you don't know ask AI for direction. This is the future and you have a window of opportunity to make your own way. In the next 2- 4 years this will be common knowledge.\n\nWe are all in this together as HUMANS. Huge changes are coming in both the AI Technological landscape and the global financial system with regards to crypto.",

During my time there I worked on multiple projects, an IT internship, and earned all three of the TestOut certificates which were available in the curriculum, that being PC Pro, Network Pro, and Security Pro, all of which were separate independent study projects.  I've listed all of the aforementioned educational experiences on my resume.  Additionally, after the first few months after graduation, I took a temporary position which lasted for two months.  Alongside my internship and work experience I've listed my academic awards, those being the certification I've earned, a perfect attendance award, and my membership to the Phi Theta Kappa Honors society.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the advice of a professor I've written a cover letter template in my own words, and a template for asking for feedback and criticism following any interviews.  That said, after applying to positions daily for a nearly a year now, I'm finding that it is more and more difficult to find positions, not only on LinkedIn, but also Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, and Monster, and I have only had a handful of interviews out of all my applications, all of which I've been rejected for, and from which I have received no feedback from the interviewers as to my interviewing performance.  I have completely rewritten my resume multiple times on the advice of a free resume critiquing service, and reached out to multiple sets of recruiting agencies, all of which eventually stopped responding to e-mails and attempts to contact them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the advice of a friend I have also started attempting to add more connections on LinkedIn, despite being highly introverted, and have accumulated over 100 connections.

It might be worth looking at just how realistic getting an IT job might be in your area as the competition might be incredibly fierce if it's a bigger city or the jobs might be scarce in a small town (i.e. only so many businesses needing a full-time IT person).

Each of those degrees prepares you slightly differently and will likely put you into a different position.\n\nSecond, what kind of jobs have you actually been looking for? Their is a big difference between a help desk support 1 job and DBA or Sysadmin position. You may be qualified solely by education for a DBA or Sysadmin position, but a help desk job with experience will let you stand out over any other new grads.\n\nThird, by whom was your degree accredited, if at all? Accreditation for colleges is often really important for a prospective employer looking for recent college grads. Its difficult to gauge how good you may be if you graduated a college that wasn't accredited.\n\nFourth, how rural of a location are you in, and where have you been looking for jobs? I understand relocation is not possible for everyone, but if you're looking no further than 10 miles out in a town of under 50k then that is probably your problem. I'd recommend making the jump and just moving somewhere where you can find more job opportunities.\n\nEDIT: Just saw the part about the city. Thats a good first step. Look even further.\n\nFifth, how were your interviews? What went wrong in them? 3 interviews with no offer or followup suggests to me that you very well may be doing something wrong, or failing a certain part of it.\n\nNow for suggestions you can do immediately:\n\nFirst, post your resumé on /r/resume to get good advice. Replace all identifying information with descriptors (instead of address state etc., put rural midwest). They'll tell you what you're doing wrong in no uncertain terms.\n\nSecond, get a survival job if you don't already have one. As someone already said, degrees have a shelf life for employers. If they see you haven't been employed for more than a year, its very tough for them to think you're employable if you weren't also studying at the same time. At least having stuff in the middle will help you a lot because it may just get passed the scanners, and then may also fall in a more lenient managers hands. The survival job, ideally, would be admin/office work. Their is no shortage of that.\n\nThird, practice and hone your skills. Where applicable, make your knowledge work for you.

Got an interview? Already signed. Imagine you ALREADY work for them. I use Notion (an app)'s database to keep track of all the positions I've applied for. You could tag each position as 'ready to apply', 'interview scheduled', 'rejected', etc. This time, when I got the interview for this position, before even going in, I ticked 'signed'. This gave me a sense of conviction for a future in which this interview led to a positive outcome. You could think of it as a form of manifestation—if you can see it happen, it will happen. This also means, of course, that you research the company INSIDE OUT. So when you are in the interview, you speak with the confidence of someone already working there.\n2. Promenade rehearsal. Every time I got a position, not just this time, I did one thing in common. I went for a walk in nature just before the interview started. While walking, I take deep breaths and I whisper my presentation to myself. I go to nature also because I probably look a bit crazy doing it. But that little walk always cleared my head and drastically reduced my anxiety. I feel ready to go when I'm back.\n3. (Edited to add one more.) Stalk your interviewers. Go do research on who's interviewing you, read their reports, papers, etc. When appropriate, address them by name and their key concept to show that your values align. I had a presentation, and I mentioned one of the interviewers by name. I think it was appreciated.\n\nThese are two things I do that I don't see covered often online. Please also keep in mind that this is something that worked for me.\n\nGood luck and you got this.  \n:)",

      "body": "I am so lucky that I have a friend who is a recruiter.\nOnce I asked her, \"How did you decide on the \"only one\" among dozens of candidates?\"\nCombining my own 17 job interviews last year and the conversation with her, I summarized some tips:\n\n#1 Learn to sell yourself. \nWhen I first heard this idea, I was confused. I obviously make a living with technology; why should I learn skills that would be useful for sales? But she told me, \"An interview is a conversation between people, not between you and a computer.\" Your tone of voice, facial expressions, and your ability to connect with people are all \"first impressions.\" Although it won't be shown on the surface and it sounds a little bit unfair, the interviewer has already started scoring you when you open the door. Learn to smile=)\n#2 Be HONEST. \nBe confident in your ability, but don't exaggerate it. (Ability is the most important point.) Don't think that your answer will be \"stupid\" or \"naive\"; don't be frustrated or afraid. (everyone has a process from 0-1, maybe the real work environment is as \"naive\" as you). If you don't have an answer, don't talk nonsense. Don't stop there, add what efforts you can make to find the answer.\n#3 It’s a game of numbers and luck. \nFrom a probability perspective, the more you apply, the more successful your resume screening will be, and the more interviews you will get. Never let a bad interview get you down, and don’t stop applying. Even if you do well in the interview and answer every question perfectly, there is still a chance that you won’t get the job. That’s okay, just be fine. It’s the company that’s not right for you, not you.\n#4 (My experience) Use efficiency tools properly. \nI am a very lazy person, but I am unwilling to fall behind in this job market. In addition to searching for interview experience and strategies on LinkedIn, YouTube, and Google, I also use some tools to help me practice for interviews (simple, easy to use, and free): Calendar on ur phone: time management, very helpful when you have multiple interview invitations. You can arrange the practice time for mock interviews reasonably, instead of rushing to do it after a weekend. Notion: record some notes about the position/product research report/interview questions and exercises. Beyz: I can directly upload my resume for mock interview. Or have a real-time interview practice with my friends. Google sheets: I will conduct a detailed review and analysis of each interview, including company background, job role, interview questions, my feelings, etc.\n\nDon't be afraid of interviews, it's a skill. Practice makes perfect, learn to tell stories. (\"sell yourself\") If you don't know how to start, you can find your friends to practice with simple chats, watch some TED talks to imitate their storytelling skills, or chat with GPT/AI interview assistants (not limited by time and place). Please remember to be confident during the interview and play to your greatest strengths. The job you dream of is coming!",

I’m the international student, My OPT was ticking. I still have big student loan debt. My family can't support me financially anymore. I was thinking of maybe it's time to go back to my home country.\n\nBut this week, I got the offer call. I still can’t believe it, I even doubt whether they might be scams. But what could they get from me? Or maybe... I don’t have to leave this summer after all.\n\nI applied to 1500+ jobs in 14 months, every rejection and ghosting hit hard. Between the mental pressure, money pressure, and just trying to survive, I nearly gave up so many times. There were nights I seriously thought about quitting, about selling my furniture and flying home. But I kept going. And I’m glad I did, I finally landed a offer.\n\nWish I can encourage anyone still job hunting in silence: hang in there, It’s possible.\n\nEdit:   \nThanks again for all the support, it's really hard to land in this brutal job market, especially for international student . Here's what I did for the whole process\n\nResume: I picked 5 data analyst job descriptions from companies I really liked and asked [ChatGPT](http://ChatGPT.com) to extract common keywords and skills. Then I had it help me rewrite my experience bullets to include those terms and add real quantified impact.\n\nApplications: I mostly used [Indeed](http://Indeed.com), [Handshake](http://Handshake.com), and [12Twenty](http://12Twenty.com) . Had much better luck there than just blindly applying on LinkedIn. Or adjust the url to get the latest job opening information on Linkedin.\n\nInterview prep: I tried [AMA Interview](http://AMAInterview.ai) for their real question sets and JD-based predictions (a few literally came up in final rounds). I know not everyone loves using AI tools, but doing daily mocks and practicing actually helped me a lot.\n\nPortfolio: I built a portfolio on [Notion](http://Notion.com) with code samples, visualizations, and short write-ups. Tried to make it clear what tools I used and what real impact the projects had.\n\nNetworking: Went to a few in-person events and used LinkedIn advanced filters to reach out to people in teams I was interested in. It was super helpful, I got 3 interviews that way and got a lot of valuable advice from people already in the industry.",

      "body": "A job was posted with a pay band, and the HIGH END of the range is 25% less than what I make now. However, I have a loose connection to the hiring manager, so we had coffee. She knows I have much more experience than the posting calls for and she says she can increase the salary for the right candidate. She’s expecting me to negotiate, but she may or may not know how much. The formal interview process begins tomorrow with HR. I don’t want to be ruled out too soon because of my salary “expectation.” Before getting into that, I’d like to blow the hiring manager away with my portfolio etc, so she will potentially be more open when I ask for more than what she’s expecting. But it’s a risky situation! What should I say when HR asks during the first round?\n\nI was thinking of saying something like “I make X (a slightly padded number) now, which I know is significantly more than what’s listed. However  I think this is a great opportunity, so I want to see what I can do to make this work, and look at a potential offer holistically”\n\nThen hopefully they won’t rule me out and if/when I get an offer, they’ll at least be in the ballpark and won’t be surprised by my ask. \n\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: hi everyone-thanks for your responses. I told them what I make (not padded) and explained that i know it may be hard for them to get there, but I value this opportunity because of xyz and I’d like to see if I can make this work. They said they are looking into reposting the job at a higher level and the salary range would be much closer to what I make now (potentially the same). \n\nMy two cents on the notion of “wasting people’s time”- now-a-days, you’re lucky to even get an interview in many fields. You’d be wasting your time not to take any chance you’re given. As long as you’re respectful (the tricky part in a situation like this) you make new connections and learn about another company through the interview process, which I value. I may have spooked them with my numbers, we’ll see! But I think I’m still in the running.

      "body": "**-Preface-**\n\nThis is quite lengthy, I apologize but I felt it was important to convey things in such a manner in order to achieve the goals I desire.\n\nI feel like I am missing something vital but I do not really know enough to know what it is I am missing. This could be something that maybe common sense to everyone else that I just haven't picked up, or this could be some deep insight that one only reaches at years of hiring people. I am not sure.\n\n*Background*: I am U.S Navy Veteran with 14 years as an Electronic Technician and I am proud of my service and of what I accomplished in my career. I am 37 years old and just had the 4th job interview in my entire life. I joined at a young age and so I am quite inexperienced in this process. I am currently employed as a work-study for my local Veteran Center but I do volunteer there as well when my schedule permits and the Veteran Center requires. \n\n*Career Experience*: I have technical experience, education and training that quite literally allows me to trace an electron from the power-plant, through a city's electrical infrastructure, into your home to a wall outlet that your PC is plugged, into the power-supply through the mother board and back out to the power-supply and then to ground. I can operate, maintain, calibrate, align, analyze, troubleshoot, and fully repair nearly any electronic device and my experience ranges from having fixed everything from wiring in your home, to soda vending machines to two-million-dollar radar systems to combat systems tactical displays to anti-submarine acoustical analysis suites. My (standard) resume is two pages long and it still doesn't cover everything I want to put into it.\n\n*Shortcomings*: While I have great technical experience, and understanding, I do not understand people. I am an introvert and prefer working with computers and electronics over people and some of this introversion has turned a bit into misanthropy. I am aware of these and I work daily to improve my social skills and my understanding of people as a whole. I try hard to see the best in people and to empathize with them and make efforts to be honest, transparent, and forthcoming when I do deal with people. Overall though, I feel that I do not understand people as a whole and the complexity of emotions that can mix together to create an individual, much less how those interact in group dynamics and even less so when it comes to even understanding myself.\n\n*Attitude*: I come here again in an attempt to gain an understanding of this whole process so understand that I do have an open mind. That said, so far my limited experiences with this has left a sour taste in my mouth, but before I completely condemn it I have come here seeking to understand it. I feel that however small an understanding I may gain from here, it will go a very long way in not only my future employment but my growth as a human being as well. \n\nThis is an advance apology for anyone who may detect my frustration, spite, resentment and otherwise poor outlook I have concerning this. I hope that maybe you guys here can change it. I do not quite know how this has happened because its supposedly the inverse of what is normal, but I overall I have had a very positive experiences when it comes to Reddit. Even just browsing around this sub-reddit, has already helped me quite a bit.\n\nSorry for the long preface, but finally I feel I can ask my question so that you may provide me with answers in a way that I can understand.\n\n\n-----\nFrom my limited experience this is some of the things I have gathered so far that baffle me.\n\n \n\n**-Resumes-**\n\n*Number of*: You need to have like at least 4 of these. One giant multiple page resume that is the Master Resume, you will use this to help you make the various other resumes listed here. One generalized summary resume that is no more than 2 pages that you use as a 'shot-gun' for applying to various places online in hopes to peek someone interests. One (or more) career-field specific resumes for a particular career-field your applying for, again used as a shot-gun but a bit more specified to highlight your experience in this field. Any number tailored resume that you use to apply to specific occupations you would like to have that suits what the company may want peruse. If your trying for multiple career fields or multiple companies, this number multiples significantly. Is this about the truth of it? if so, why is it this way?\n\n*Formatting*: Beyond the number of these you need to have, many places seem to want their own specific formatting. I seems could pay 6 different resume professionals and I would have ended up with like 12 vastly different resumes from each of them. There does seem to be some general rules to the formatting, but I can not help but feel that it’s entirely asinine at this point and it’s there only as a potential justification to discriminate potential employees. Why does each company want a different format for your resume?\n\n*Worthlessness*: Once you get to the interview process, resumes become worthless, toilet paper has more value. No one in my experience has seemingly even bothered to have read my resume. I have yet to have a question that would have been seemingly generated from the information I put in the resume, even if that resume is tailored specifically to their company. In the few interviews I have had, I have repeatedly provided interviewers with the exact same information contained in my resume about my career experience and education. Why does a person spend so many hours involved in their resume when not even the people the resume is intended for even bothers to read them? \n\n*References*: Why have these been removed from a resume? Yes, you are expected to provide them on request, but seems like a potential resource that could readily be used. \n\n \n\n**-Interview Process-**\n\n*Acts in Deception*: To me, the whole premise of this process is an exercise in deception and there to test your ability to BS while they BS you in return. As I understand you are expected to present the 'best version' of yourself. This seems like BS to me because a person either has yet experiences the best versions of themselves, or if they have, they would not know it. For me personally, I honestly feel that the best version of myself was when I hit that bases-loaded homerun in little-league when I was 12 years old. This notion is also odd to me, because rarely is a person a reflection of their best versions, and if they are there is a good chance it will not be at the work place. If anything, it would make sense to me to ask to see the worst version of a potential employee so they know exactly how petty, passive-aggressive, spiteful or ugly you CAN get. When you make these points, you alternatively receive the advice that you should just Oversell yourself. If I was applying for a sales job, I would understand this, but I am applying for a technical occupation, it makes sense to me that accuracy, honesty, and transparency would be of higher value. \n\nAs mentioned, I am not the best when it comes to social interaction, so I am not skilled in deception and thus those are my standards, if anything I am humble in comparison. On the resume I am currently using, I have over-inflated some of the savings I have made to tax-payers with my time in the military when I in fact know the actual value down to the nickel I have actually saved tax-payers. I know this because of the monthly reports I had to make to the US Navy regarding my savings. The fact that I have rounded up and even ..embellished.. somewhat on those savings has my resume feeling to me like a work of fiction.  \n\nMy last interview the interviewers opened by asking me specifics about various electronic components and reading detailed schematics, and this made me quite happy because I had those answers, I knew those answers, I am exceedingly happy to troubleshoot down to the component level and to have the opportunity to utilize these skills I have. There was no indication from before my interview that this job would NOT require these skills, knowledge, and experience. When I asked some follow on questions later on, it became apparent to me that for the performance of this job, they do not trouble shot down to component level, they replace modules and assemblies. I asked a bit for some clarification on that; I know that many companies can not afford to have assembly lines that are down for any length of time and they will replace modules and circuit cards and assemblies to return the line to operation, in turn the modules will repaired and returned to service afterward. For this job though, troubleshooting down to the component level is never done, the modules are instead sent off to be repaired by the manufacturer. This is quite standard in the industry and very understandable, but it bothered me, it felt like utter BS that they expect potential employees to have knowledge, experiences, and skills in areas that this occupation never encounters. The job isn’t that hard, they just have difficult interview questions. They over-represented the difficulties and challenges of the job and I am expected to over-sell and/or over-market myself.\n\nMy question is; how is someone who values honesty, transparency, and accuracy; someone who is uncomfortable being deceptive or lying or even ‘over-selling’ themselves supposed to market themselves to an interviewer who themselves are both expecting to be lied to and who may or may not be deceiving a potential future employee?\n\n \n\n**-Conclusion-**\n\nI have plenty of other questions, but this is already substantially long so I will leave things here for now. Thank you in advance for any questions you answer for me, any insights you are able to share, or for just even bothering to read this to begin with. Know that I have already tried to condense this and shorten it and in that vein is why I decided to leave things here for now. As both customary and courtesy here in Reddit though, I will provide a TL:DR but it will not be the standard TL:DR, instead it will just be a reposting of my questions, but without all the context surrounding it.\n\n \n\n**-TL:DR-**\n\n* Why does each company demand/require their own personalized specific ‘formatted-their-way’ resume? \n\n* To accomplish this, how many different versions of your resume do you maintain actively?\n\n* Why is a person expected to spend so many hours involved in their resume when not even the people the resume is intended for (the Interviewers) even bother to read them? \n\n* Why are references no longer included in a resume? \n\n* How is an introvert who values honesty, transparency, and accuracy; someone who is uncomfortable being deceptive or lying or even ‘over-selling’ themselves supposed to market themselves to an interviewer who themselves are both expecting to be lied to and who may or may not be deceiving a potential future employee?\n\nAgain, thank you in advance for any questions you answer for me and/or any insights you are able to share.\n\nEdit: Formatting.",

          "body": "I didn't read all of this, but jumping through a your piece, there's a theme. To some degree you think selling is inherently lying.\n\nI think, by the way, you've outlined a lot of the major problem most people have with finding a job. Most of what you're doing is pointless for you. It's not pointless for the recruiter.\n\nThink of this process as a weeding out, a cleansing of the not so motivated, a process of demonstrating that you can do work. It's not what you're hired to do, but basic skills are important in any job.\n\nBut anyway, back to selling. I felt the same way about selling for years. Why do I need to BS myself in to a job? The simple answer is you don't have to. If you are, you may not actually be qualified for the role.\n\nI was taught something in a sales class (ironically I found my self in a software sales job), and the presenter presented a paradigm that shifted my whole perspective -- changed the way I saw everything. He simply said, my aim in sales is to be as absolutely 100% honest as I can be, because my customers will find out one way or another that I am lying to them.\n\nNow this sounds like, yeah, duh right. We know that. But to hear this from a dude who tours the US and charges 50k to talk to a room for the day, he was going to give us a lecture on how to sell honest? It blew me away.\n\nMy point is think about the problem of finding a job and try to shift your perspective from tricking them in to hiring you through playing the game right, to a methodology of preparing for a test, and in this test you need to answer some basic questions about who you are as a person and find a narrative to attach to that story, that narrative should align with the companies mission and your long term goals, and come from a place of honesty.\n\nThat shift, and looking at the problem of selling from a different angle changed my whole life. Things like the job search, which before gave me so much anxiety, no longer did. Because even I can walk in to a room confidently and be myself and tell them a story about us, and why we work. \n\nCheers\n",

      "body": "I'm still in shock as I write this. After 2000+ applications, countless rejections, and one mental breakdown in a Starbucks bathroom, I've finally received not one but TWO data analyst offers! Just 6 months ago, I was a fresh MS Analytics grad with a sociology background who couldn't tell you the difference between a dashboard and a DataFrame.\n\nMy Background: I studied Sociology for my undergrad with literally zero technical skills, then completed my MS in Analytics (graduated Dec 2024). My only relevant experience was a Data Analyst capstone project during grad school, which honestly wasn't enough for most employers. Classic catch-22 of needing experience to get experience.\n\nMy journey went something like this:  \nOct-Nov 2024: Total cluelessness, I sent 800+ applications with the same generic resume to every company. Got rejected from like 99% of them. Got 1 phone screen where they asked about window functions and I froze up completely. Then had a technical interview where I bombed a simple SQL question about JOINs because I was so unprepared. Super depressing time.  \nDec 2024: Regrouping. I stopped applying for about 3 weeks to figure out what was going wrong. Made a spreadsheet to track applications and created 2 different resume versions for different roles (marketing analytics, and general data analysis). Started the Google Data Analytics and Advanced Data Analytics certs on Coursera. Began doing SQL on Leetcode every day, even on Christmas (my family thought I was being antisocial lol).  \nJan-Mar 2025: The grind. With my new strategy, I sent out 1200+ targeted applications to companies I actually researched. Got 15 phone screens, 8 technical interviews, and 4 final rounds. Practiced SQL for 2 hours daily until I could do it in my sleep. Built some Tableau dashboards using real datasets instead of that overused Superstore data everyone uses. Started following up on applications which actually helped a lot.  \nApril 2025: Finally some luck!!! All the hard work paid off. Got offered an Associate Data Analyst job at a startup and a Marketing Data Analyst position at a retailer. After so many months of struggle, having choices felt weird.\n\nWhat actually worked for me:\n\n1. Getting better at interviews, not just applications After sending 800+ applications with almost no response, I realized quantity wasn't the answer. Started doing quality applications and really preparing for interviews. Used Claude to help me prepare 12 stories for behavioral questions and practiced until they felt natural. Huge difference in how I came across.\n2. Actually learning the skills SQL went from basic SELECT statements to solving most hard Leetcode problems. Made 3 Tableau dashboards that weren't terrible. Took Udemy courses on A/B testing and actually understood the stats behind it. The Google certs were surprisingly helpful too.\n3. Using the right resources in the right order First for learning:\n\n\\- Started with Coursera's Google certs to build a foundation (both the Data Analytics and Advanced Data Analytics ones). Then used Udemy for targeted skills (their SQL and Tableau courses were actually useful for real work).\n\n\\- For practice: Leetcode was my daily workout for SQL problems. Kaggle helped me practice on real datasets and build projects I could actually talk about in interviews.\n\n\\- For job hunting: Started with LinkedIn for big companies, added Handshake which connected me with alumni recruiters (surprisingly helpful!), and ZipRecruiter found me some hidden gems not posted elsewhere.\n\n\\- For applications: Claude became my personal career coaches. I used them to tailor my resume for each job, analyze descriptions word by word, and find the exact keywords that would get past ATS systems.\n\n\\- For interview prep:  I used AMAInterview for mock practice, it's way cheaper than hiring a career coach, and I could practice at 2am in my pajamas 😂 Instant feedback really helped me fix my rambling problem!\n\n\\- For portfolio building: After searching and watching tutorial videos, I created a GitHub to store my code and show I understand version control. Then made a Notion portfolio that looked way better than my resume for showcasing projects in a clean format. Having links to both on my applications definitely got me more interviews.\n\nThings I wish someone told me earlier:\n\n\\- Having a liberal arts degree can actually be helpful if you know how to talk about it\n\n\\- Being able to communicate clearly is just as important as technical skills\n\n\\- Following up on applications actually works sometimes\n\n\\- Companies need people who can explain data to non-technical folks, not just coding wizards\n\nIf you're struggling right now, I get it. Six months ago I literally cried after bombing a technical interview. Now I'm picking between offers. I went with the second offer. The startup seemed cool but the bigger company has better training and benefits. Ask me anything if it helps!",

This way, I can have a co-pilot by my side during interviews, helping me bring up the most relevant experiences from my past to answer the interviewer's questions. Does anyone know of a tool that can accomplish this?",

      "body": "I want to pass on this joy and luck to everyone after receiving the offer I desired not long ago. Along with documenting my job search experience, I also wrote a summary of this hard time in my life. (This is also a self-archive, I always feel that I will use it in the future lol)\n1. Put down your phone and focus on professional platforms.\nTrust me, divide the time you spend on TikTok and Instagram with LinkedIn and YouTube. You will gain twice as much as before. Keep an eye out for posts from industry experts that share their experiences on projects, their grievances at work, or simply a vlog of their workday. You can quickly understand the real content and working environment of the job by watching these, so as to set your own psychological expectations.\n2. Don’t block your own shot. \nOne application, one comment, one small talk, one DM are all fine. Give a brief introduction, highlight a significant accomplishment, and highlight your abilities and strengths. Opportunities are not only for those who are prepared, but also for those who have **the courage** to take the first step.\n3. Customize multiple versions of your resume and keep track of your progress. \nPrepare several different types of resumes (if you intend to apply for multiple positions). Create a spreadsheet (such as Google Sheet &amp; Notion) to record the date and results of each application such as rejection, resume review, interview, offer, etc. Update your resume and job search strategy every week so that you can clearly see which methods are effective and which ones need to be adjusted. ps: Be mindful of modifying your commute time, some recruiters will care about this.\n4. Collect interview questions and practice your expression skills repeatedly.\nSort out interview questions related to the position, especially those related to business scenarios. To find out if these questions are truly fitting for you, you can use them to model potential future work situations. If you know nothing about a certain field, try to use sns or GPT to learn about it. Finding an interview cheat sheet for the relevant position is the best course of action. You can ask your friends to do simulation exercises, or practice on your own. I typically use Beyz to help me practice with simulated real-time interviews, and then record each result in Notion for review and sorting. Naturally, AI copilot is only an emergency auxiliary tool, and you are the one who will play in the end.\n5. Data tracking and summary feedback\nIntegrate all information into Google Sheets, including job title, content, resume version, interview questions, your perceived strengths, mock interview feedback, and personal summary. In this way, you can not only evaluate which strategies are effective, but also continuously improve yourself and make accurate choices.\nThis process has helped me avoid many detours in my jobhunting. Hope you guys are doing well!!",

      "body": "Hi All,\n\nI'm torn between 2 options and would appreciate your perspecrive.\n\nSo I had the first interview, recruiter call, yesterday, for a role that would be fixed to 18 months considering someone started right away. If it takes longer to get the person on board, the contract would be even shorter. \n\nThe company actually seems cool &amp; modern, the recruiter was also very pleasant to talk to. It went so well that I got a confirmation during the call I made it to the 2nd round. However, he was open about the contract unlikely converting into a permanent one.\n\nAnd here is the catch: the 2nd round is a case study. I would need to create a slide deck and, if successful after peer review, present my ideas during the peer interview. The case study is about general questions, so it does not make an impression that they would be trying to get candidates to do free work.  If the case study and the peer interview are successful, one would have yet one more interview with some upper management people. \n\nIt is not a director or leadership role, but an individual contributor. 4 interview rounds seem way over the top for any role IMO, but for 12+ months contract? I am based in an EU country where fixed-term contracts are rare in general.\n\nI am torn: I've been laid off and unemployed since October, so I am tempted to do it. On the other hand, by doing it, I would be investing tones of my time with no guarantee of anything, and reinforcing the notion that companies can drag candidates around just because the job market now is in a bad state. \n\nI have a couple of other interviews coming up but nothing near closing... However, I am still tempted to reply to that email that I see it as way too excessive for a fixed-term contract.\n\nAny takes on this? Thanks!\n\n",

      "body": "Hello everyone! I recently had a final interview for a dream job two days ago. Both of the interviews I did went amazing and they gave cues leaning toward the notion that I was gonna get the job. At the end of the final interview I asked if there was a timeline I should be aware of in terms of getting an offer or not and my interviewer said she wasn’t sure, and that it was more of a question that her boss would know. The first interview I did was with boss. Should I send a thank you email and also ask about a timeline? I realize it’s only been 2 days since my last interview but not knowing when I should expect an answer is killing me. I’ve been looking for my next job for about 9 months. Thank you for the advice guys. Cheers!",

They don't have a timeline because they are interviewing multiple candidates and don't know if you are their #1 candidate or not. If you don't hear back within a week, you can assume you are not their #1 candidate. Sometimes you can still get the job even if you aren't the #1 because the #1 backs out (offer too low, received a better offer elsewhere, etc). \n\nRegardless, you should always continue looking, applying, and interviewing until you receive and accept an offer.",
