If they have experience, the companies go off of that. Yes, those companies take the same risk hiring those people, so no the interviews we do are not needed.\n\nI don't see this mentality in pretty much any other industry (in b4 reddit comes up with the exception to the rule). \n\nAll this mentality does is enable managers to take advantage of you with almost no benefit to you at all. \n\nCan we please stop with this stupid mentality in this industry?

How else did you get to a post titled \"Officially given up on trying to get a job as a software developer.\" Well, after 1 year of being a SWE, I think I got some advice for you. Network. No, not LAN or WAN, actually go out and talk to people (or write a Reddit post from the comfort of your home). Look for STEM job fairs: your College/Uni will likely host some throughout the year, or if there are any others that you could go to (SHPE for example). Applying online feels like a void that just sucks up job applications, so definitely try your best to get face to face with a recruiter. The rest is up to you and how well you can prepare for the interviews that I'm sure you'll be getting when people see the determination you need to have. Best of luck, sadcsgrad out.",

Most robotics, ML, and compiler jobs are staffed by experienced engineers with masters degrees (something you could go get (look at OMSCS), but right now you need any job.  \nIf you really want to do ML, one option to just start working is to apply to small companies looking for data analysts and just work up from there. Just find a place that will let you get your foot in the door, and pay you to analyze data. You can use your ML skills (and develop more) while you are there.  \nThe second option is to go after backend engineering jobs: most of us are getting paid to write api endpoints for some server that talks to another server. Pick a language like Java, and learn a few of the libraries for writing web servers really well. If you do, a company will scoop you up based on your CS degree and those skills alone.  \n\n\nFinally, it's okay to shift your focus onto easier/less prestigious jobs in the short-term, but keep your sights on Robotics/ML in the long term. Any job where you write code for a living with other people reviewing it will teach you a ton, and after a few years you can consider if you want to go back and get your masters, or work on a masters degree part time. After a few more years (and success at your jobs), you'll start to have access to positions your resume is focused on getting now.",

      "body": "After getting fired from my first job 6 months in back in 2021 I went into a state of depression and burnout. I could no longer find joy in programming, with time however, I recovered. I am now as motivated as when I first started out. I got back up on my feet after I started building out my passion project which reignited that spark.\n\nI started applying at the worst time possible, when I could have easily gotten an offer during the hiring surge in early 2022 (Clickup was literally hiring HTML/CSS Developers). However, I came to realize that if I had managed to get my first job in 2021 with no relevant experience, I could do it again in 2023 with the hiring freeze and layoffs, even if the odds seems stacked against me.\n\nThis offer is a 70% increase in salary from my previous job! I am still in a state of shock to just know that someone would be willing to pay me this much, especially since I have no educational background and was an unemployed loser. They use the latest tech and are also a mid-sized company!\n\nEstimation Time: 2 months and 15 days of jobs searching.I started low and then eventually worked my way up to 100+ applications a day. Around 30 interviews/phone calls. 5 final stages. One offer was about to be on the table until they realized I didn’t have a degree (this really put a chip on my shoulder).\n\nAnd not a single damn Leetcode interview through the graces of God.Background: I have no degree, and completely self-taught. I got my first job at 19 only after one term of university and dropped out.\n\nHere’s how I got back into the market with such a huge gap on my resume. Note: this is just based on my experience and presumptions.\n\n1. Mass apply, it quite literally is a numbers game. If there are thousands of job listings out there, eventually one will say yes. Do be careful of recruiting agencies, I tend to avoid job listings by them since they seem to be a waste of time.\n2. Exaggerate, embellish your work/experience but NEVER lie. You’re here to brag about yourself and how cool you are. The company is also doing the same so it’s okay to do the same.\n3. Polish your resume, this is REALLY important. Make it look structured and not something a kid could easily do.\n4. F\\*ck cover letters\n5. If you’re new to the industry, don’t ever apply jobs that uses myworkday job applications, they’re a WASTE of time.\n6. Most offers for juniors will require relocation sadly.\n7. NEVER talk sh\\*t about your previous employers\n8. Ask questions, not just any questions but GOOD questions. Show you’re interested in the company as well as trying to succeed. You’ll also learn a lot if they’re a sh\\*tty company to begin with.\n9. Jobs with 200+ applications? Apply anyways, I’ve gotten responses from them before.\n10. Have decent projects that you could talk about and explain your approach to building things\n11. Hone in on your “tell me about yourself“ answer and recite it. Make it interesting and RELEVANT\n12. Don’t forget to smile :D\n13. If you’re religious, pray. Count your blessings and do it with the right intentions. Ask yourself why do you want a dev job? To continue being a resentful pr\\*ck? To one day help and lead others? To support your family? To support yourself? Greed?\n14. EDIT: Also don't be disheartened if your interview didn't go well. I always use them as practice for my next one!  \nI was very indecisive about whether or not I should post this, but decided to because I see so many negative posts on here about people not finding a job so I thought it's the least I could do by sharing some good news.Link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oqowsm/jusgotlaioffdutoundeperformanceafter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oqowsm/jusgotlaioffdutoundeperformanceafter/)",

      "body": "There's many posts in here about how people have \"great qualifications\" but can't find a job, causing everyone to circlejerk about how bad the market is, and vice-versa for people who find jobs with minimum qualifications. The problem is that little context is given, and these posts skew readers' attitudes towards the industry in harmful ways.\n\nFor example, I know someone who on paper looks amazing: 3.8 GPA in Computer Science BS, Computer Science MS with a good thesis project, three semesters as a tutor, side projects, etc. However, it's been 11 months since she graduated and she's unemployed, despite having applied to hundreds of places.\n\nIf she posted on here, everyone would think \"wow, the job market is horrible\". The truth is, she cheated through most of her classes and took the easiest electives possible, she was a tutor for a class where no one showed up to tutoring, and her final master's project was part of a group where she did minimal work. She has minimal to no work ethic, has turned down interviews because she did not want to get up too early, etc. She doesn't want to do any leetcode or prep because it is \"irrelevant to the job\", but it's obvious to people who know her that it is out of laziness.\n\nIf I were to hear all of her stats in a vacuum, or a reddit post, I'd be impressed, but it doesn't reflect reality at all. **Some people are just lazy/incompetent,** and everyone needs to stop blaming the \"job market\" when unemployment is at a huge low. I've seen posts on here where almost everyone agreed with the OP that the job market was terrible, not even entertaining the remote possibility that the OP was just not good at CS. Everyone I know with a good work ethic and who can code well has a decent/good job, no matter their GPA or college.\n\n**The point of this post** is that many stories on here should only make you question the poster's capabilities, not the job market, and that you should not become disheartened from the posts.",

One of them is because their investors believe they are hiring and doing well.\n* Dragging you through 8 interviews while having no intention of hiring you. Stringing you along, in other words. Again, I have inside information, whether you believe me or not, and it is very common. This is why I set my limit to 3 interviews. No more than that. Take it or leave it. Chances are that if they are dragging you for more than 3 interviews, they have no intention of hiring you. \n* Extorting free labor through false promises. They tell you to design and implement a project to solve a specific problem. You pour your soul into it... The company has now resolved their problem, and they no longer need to hire you. And you're the sucker. They ghost you. \n* Fake recruiters who just want your info for data mining. They pay a fee on LinkedIn to post fake jobs. LinkedIn refuses to take them down. For these fake recruiters, the benefit deriving from data mining justifies the small price they have to pay to post fake jobs. Lensa might be legitimate, but they engage in data mining. They are trash. \n* Be careful because here on reddit there are a lot of shills or shillers, whatever you call them.

Job market is not that bad for Senior SWEs. TC &gt;$100k + Fully Remote. I'm a US Citizen.*\n\nI always see the doom and gloom from this sub regarding layoffs and the struggles of people finding a job and wanted to add a counter-story. I got laid off from my job on July 14th. It was an absolute gut punch and all of my worst fears came true. I saw all the posts from people with years of experience struggle with finding a job and thought I was absolutely screwed going into the market. Thankfully, either I have a really good skill set or people are being overly pessimistic (though it is most likely a combination of both.)\n\nI do think that there is still merit to the doom and gloom though. When looking for a job, there were barely any new grad, entry level, or junior level job postings. Most of the jobs that I saw started at senior and made their way up but it seems that the market for mid and senior level roles is still relatively healthy. Almost every position that I interviewed for was hybrid, with a good chunk being 5 days a week in person. A very small minority were fully remote.\n\nAs for how I went about that job search, the day I got laid off I got an invite to a \"Mandatory Meeting\" with my boss + some random person that I didn't know at exactly 9AM. I knew then it was over and immediately started polishing my resume and applying to every company that I could think of. I went directly to the career page and found jobs that I thought that I was qualified for. I may have applied to every company that I can think of, but I only applied to roles that matched my skillset. Every single job that I applied to was either directly on the company page or LinkedIn jobs sorted by last 24 hours.\n\nI did NOT use any AI - this includes auto-apply software or even tuning my resume. Everything was done by hand, manually by me. The only \"automation\" that I did was sign up for a [greenhouse.io](http://greenhouse.io) account so that my name, email, and other info was autofilled by them.\n\nThe first 48 hours was the hardest because it was just sending applications into the void without knowing if it would yield anything. Then starting Wednesday that same week, I started getting interview requests and stopped applying to new jobs. I did not ask my network for any references as I was not desperate yet.\n\nFor context, I am in the San Francisco Bay Area and work in the biotech industry (and if you're on r/biotech, biotech is equally screwed as tech, if not more.) The job I got is in the healthcare field but unrelated to the job I previously had. TC is a nice bump up from my previous position but I will not share it since people in real life know what my Reddit handle is (but I can say that it is more than $100,000 but less than $1,000,000.) I have 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer in various healthcare companies ranging from small startups to large companies with both a CS and biology degree from UC Berkeley.\n\nOf course, this is just one data point. YMMV\n\nTo those still hunting, good luck.",

      "body": "******\nNote: It's been brought to my attention that this post has been mentioned in a [Joma Tech video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGflHj1SjA4) on Youtube and it appears that Joma has gotten my post mixed up with the [2.9 GPA post](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6278bi/my_journey_and_tips_29_gpa_at_a_noname_liberal/) by u/elliotbot. Just wanted to clarify that we aren't the same person and the person being interviewed in the video is u/elliotbot and not me :)\n******\n\nWhen I graduated a year ago, I failed all my interviews with the Big X even after grinding through about 200 leetcode questions. So I decided to try something different with my new wave of studying a couple of months later while I was working as a software engineer at one of the companies I did get an offer from (enterprise software company). \n\nI started out by doing some research on how to effectively learn, and found a relatively well known and free online course called [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). The course is rather short and only took me about 8 hours to go through, but what I learned from it was a huge help.\n\nAfter completing the course, I decided to use this free promo code for interviewcake that I got from a hackathon and went through about half of the problems on that website (did about 20 problems). Most of them problems were ones I’ve already seen on leetcode, so it was more of a warm up / review. One thing new thing I did was to write down each problem I did in a google sheets document along with the date I solved the problem (linked in the bottom). I would then review the problems I did for the past week to make sure I didn’t forget how to do them. This was a tip I picked up from the online course -- the power of recalling + spaced repetition.\n\nNext, I grabbed a copy of Elements of Programming Interviews in Python (if you’re going to buy it, make sure to check [their website](http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/) to see how to get the latest version and also use their free command line judging tool to check your answers). I also learned python specifically for interviewing because of how concise the language is, meaning you could write your code much faster, which I think played a notable role in my interviews. I started going through EPI’s study guide mentioned in one of their intro chapters that had a list of recommended problems. I decided to go with EPI because I’ve already gone through 200 leetcode questions, but I wanted to read the more in depth explanations that EPI had and learn how the book explains the solutions to problems so that I could pull off something similar when explaining / solving problems in interviews. I ended up solving about 2/3s of the problems that were in the study guide.\n\nBy this point, I felt ready to start interviewing. At least for the little guys. So I started mass applying to companies that I was only mildly interested in, saving my top choices like the Big X for last, as I would be more prepared for those interviews after prepping more with both the practice problems and with actual interviews with the companies I am less interested in.\n\nI got a massive number of rejections (see the second to last paragraph for stats). But every once in a while, I did get an interview too and I made sure to utilize them. I should mention that with one year of experience, I was applying to mostly entry level positions, but if a company didn’t list any entry level ones, I applied to more senior positions, whether or not I qualified for them. I did get a few interviews for those senior positions btw. I had about  2 or 3 interviews a week for a couple of weeks from this.\n\nAfter doing about a dozen interviews, I started feeling more confident and was ready to start applying to my top choices. This is where I started using leetcode again. I got the leetcode premium subscription for a month to practice tagged questions for specific companies I was interviewing for.\n\nFinally, it was time for the Big X interviews. I took two weeks off from work and scheduled all of my Big X interviews to take place in these two weeks. There were several leetcode questions of varying difficulties that were presented, some I recall from EPI as well, but also a go\nod number of questions that I’ve never heard of. Nevertheless, after being exposed to so many problems and working through them, you’ll start to get a feel of how to approach most problems. I definitely didn’t ace every single interview. There were several interviews where there was plenty of room to improve my solutions, even some that I didn’t finish coding up the solution for. But I made sure to explain every detail of my thought process. Try to keep talking. Vocalize everything you are writing on the whiteboard. Draw examples. I’m sure you’ve seen a lot of these tips, but ultimately, the most important factor was just to practice enough to the point where you can tackle almost any problem thrown at you. Do a lot of different type of problems. Review them, and thoroughly understand them.\n\n[Here are all the problems I worked on for this wave of studying](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ciClTiWWmrDL6sFnNWJj0dga2BC3x0l44tkvaAfkQo4/edit?usp=sharing), which I reviewed via recalling, religiously. Problems prefixed like “14.4 &lt;problem name&gt;” are from EPI chapter 14 problem 4 (mapping depends on book version). Problems prefixed like “128. &lt;problem name&gt;” are from leetcode. The others are from various sources, such as interview cake. \n\nIn the end, I received 5 offers (3 from the Big X), and about 100 rejections (individual companies, if it was just applications then more like 300 rejections), including the companies I never heard back from. I did a total 11 onsites and 23 technical phone screens where I had to code. I also tracked every minute I spent studying and for this study wave, I spent 130 hours. For the previous wave about a year ago where I was primarily grinding leetcode, I spent 275 hours. \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions you have and I will try to get back to everyone, at least eventually.

      "body": "For anyone looking at my Reddit post history, it would be easy to notice that I have been struggling to land a new job in this tough market.\n\nAs a completely self-taught backend engineer, without a university degree nor boot camp, rather just a love for technologies and programming from a young age, and a few years of experience in a very small non-profit organization, the market has not been easy on me at all. During my job hunting journey, I have applied for more than 800 jobs, conducted more than 70 interviews, and was a finalist in the hiring process about 10 times. Yet regardless of that, there was always a candidate more favorable than me which got chosen, until this exact day.\n\nToday I have received an email which was quite unexpected. I have been offered a full-time remote position as a software engineer in an international mid-sized company, with big customer base and highly distributed systems. The offer I received is realistic and slightly above average for my years of experience and the consideration it's a fully remote position, therefore I have gladly signed it and accepted it.\n\nThe agenda of my post is first and foremost spreading some positivity and hope in this Subreddit in these tough market conditions, because I feel like many people can use it here as a motivation to keep trying. Secondly, I would like to celebrate this moment here in this Subreddit and post about the good times, the same as I did when I posted about the bad times.\n\nI wish everyone out there the best of luck in their job hunting journey, and as I said I want to shed some light and spread positivity proving that it is possible to get offers with the right skills, hard work, consistency, and a bit of luck.\n\nGood luck everyone!",

I live in an apartment with my girlfriend, and 3 other roommates. This is the only place that I can afford that still allows me to save money (found the place through a family friend…super cheap for this area).\n\nAnyways, I’m tired of dead end jobs that lead nowhere. I’m tired of jobs that don’t fulfill me. Jobs that take much more than they give. Jobs that pay nothing and ask too much. Cooking is fun; I get to create. But the pay is shit. The environment is shit. Half your coworkers will quit one day and be replaced the next by a band of psychotic crackheads. \n\nWhen I was a kid I wanted to be an inventor (stupid) and absolutely loved the idea of building and creating. I would make origami constantly, build puzzles with family, etc etc. I taught myself how to produce music over the course of 4 years, and eventually learned to cook. All of these things are great and fun, but they don’t fully scratch the itch (or pay my bills).\n\nI wanted something to drive me forwards, something that can keep me engaged and striving for more. Something with no limits, something where I could create anything. Something that would make my dreams tangible. In comes engineering (mainly, software engineering). I tried it, I liked it right away. I get to create, I get to learn, and I get to work towards a career goal. In comes Reddit.\n\nI decided that I wanted to go to school for CS and pursue swe. Found a school, got ready to apply, but before I did I wanted to do research. So I got on reddit and started reading about stuff, and lo and behold it seems that everyone on reddit either\n A.

Wants to kill themselves because they hate working as a swe \n\nSo is this industry truly so miserable and horrible? Should I abandon all hope and join the doom train before I even start? Or are these just people that have never worked other jobs? People that went into college fresh out of hs?

Wants to kill themselves because they hate being in school for CS \n\nIt's a tough degree.  You have to learn a lot of advanced math but you _also_ have to produce working projects on a semi-regular basis.  A good BS-er can get through an English lit degree, but you can't BS code.  If it doesn't work, you fail.  My son is a junior right now and he's pulled some long nights trying to get the #*()@ thing to work, and I remember doing the same back in the 80's myself.\n\n&gt; B. Wants to kill themselves because they can’t find a job (and hate the interviews) \n\nI've been surprised seeing these posts on here over the past year or so - this is the first time I ever remember \"layoffs\" and \"programmers\" going together.

I've been doing this professionally for quite a while longer than you've been alive - the technology has changed, but the nature of the work hasn't because people haven't.  On the one hand, it's not physically demanding work and realistically, once you know what you're doing it's not _that_ mentally demanding, although it takes a while to really know what you're doing.  It is interesting, non-repetitive work.\n\nThe downsides are: you're beneath _everybody_, for some inexplicable reason.  Everybody in the entire organization, somehow, is your boss, and you're always apologizing to _them_ even though they can't do what you do and you _can_ do what they do.  Your personal time is never respected; if somebody else did something stupid even though you told them not to and it causes a problem, _you_ still have to work late to fix it.

I've loved it, and I've seen ups and downs, and there have been projects that have been more challenging to work on than others. \n\nOne of this biggest issues is that software engineering has been glamorized by influencers who make it look like they casually sit around all day and peruse some code and simply create new things at their leisure. \n\nThe reality is that a lot of people who are interested in the general idea of software engineering don't realize how technically demanding it actually is. You often spend far more time reading through code and documentation than typing it up. You spend a lot of time digging into technical issues that are preventing your code from working, and often it's not going to be apparent without digging in and doing effective research. Many people find out really quickly at this point that they are interested in the general idea of software and code but are not interested in diving that deep into the technical details. \n\nThe second aspect about this is the fact that when you're working for someone, the time spent implementing a feature is a cost to the business and to make the business's investment into that project feasible, it needs to be done within a certain time frame compared to the revenue that feature will generate. You then end up not only working on singing technical problems, but you're working on it with the pressure of a deadline. Sometimes that might mean you work late. Oftentimes that means you really try to focus as much as possible while at work. This can really cause a lot of people in the field really not like the nature of the work.\n\nWe've had a strong push to get more software engineers in the field, and during the Great Resignation, the hiring standards were very lax. So now we have a lot of people who have been in software engineering that weren't necessarily properly qualified. These people often drop out of software engineering or get laid off and move to a different career field. \n\nI'll always encourage anyone to try software engineering, but take some challenging classes where you really have to solve complex engineering problems within a deadline to see how you like it. After a couple classes you'll likely be able form an opinion on whether you like it or not. \n\nAs far as finding jobs is concerned, you'll want to get with experience while I'm school. Try to get into some internships or do some freelancing on the side. This will be challenging but will really help to build a strong resume. Don't rely on school alone. \n\nJust my thoughts and what I've seen. There are plenty of other people with different opinions who have seen different things to consider as well.

I also had just bought a house and spent a chunk of savings on renovations. \n\nA recruiter hits me up and mentions a big salary increase at their company. I figured sure why not talk to them. I had 2 calls and next was to be with the founder. Turns out the founder knew the CEO of my company. He called my CEO and said I was looking around. I was immediately fired with no severance. \n\nSince then I’ve sent out thousands of applications and had tons of interviews. Most companies had 4+ rounds. 3 months later I get an offer but instead of remote like they initially said, they wanted me to work in their office on the other side of the country for six months before going remote. I turned it down figuring another offer would come soon. It didn’t. \n\n I’ve dealt with horrible hiring managers, a couple examples is one asked me about my parents occupations and then turned me down saying they wanted someone who grew up around success so they knew what it looked like. one company had me write a blog as part of the process and months after being ghosted by them I found my blog on their website.

They started by saying the because I am not meeting expectations of the role, I am being let go. Didn’t really give any detailed explanation except that their decision is final. I was too stunned to even challenge them but it would have been futile as they said it was final. This was unexpected because I had my annual review a month ago and my rating across all categories was ‘meeting expectations’, there was one area which was identified as needing improvement and we worked on a plan to improve it this year. I was even keeping my manager informed about my progress. But then this happened today. \n\nFeels weird to be escorted out of the building after a 5 minute conversation. In a way I am relieved because I was overworked and not really happy with my job, but now I am wondering if I will ever get hired. This incident will be difficult to explain in future interviews if I don’t have enough details to explain (don’t want to lie), and regardless of what I say my employer/ manager will have an upper hand in case of a background check. \n\nTwo questions- How do people get over it and is this the end of the road?\n\nEDIT - thank you kind strangers for the positive messages and the valuable advice. I am overwhelmed with the number of responses and upvotes (this is my biggest Reddit post ever). I can’t respond to all of you individually so adding to the post if you’re interested. \n\n- will apply for unemployment. I am Canadian so it is a different but simpler process here compared to the States.\n\n- Not exactly PIPed. This was the first year they introduced this rating system and removed any peer feedback. So it was basically how your manager interpreted your performance. Last year I was told everyone likes my can do attitude, to this year one person weighing in on everything. \n\n- I was told that one of the things in my job description was to actively engage potential clients and the way I was doing it could be improved. For example, Manager insisted that I meet clients in person rather than give them the option of both virtual versus in-person. I suggested that it was unreasonable to insist on in-person meeting and clients should be free to decide. But it is what it is. \n\n- relieved that I don’t have to deal with my manager everyday. But it was a punch to the gut when I started speaking about how I am delivering on the team’s annual objectives and I am ahead of schedule, but they just cut me short and said our decision is final. \n\n- It was one of those places where the leadership has been around for 12+ years and with the exception of 2-3 people majority of the staff has a tenure of less than 4 years. \n\n- Focusing on things I gave up to impress people at work. Starting my guitar practice and reading more.\nWon’t give up, this too shall pass.\n\nUpwards and onwards! \n",

I did think about not showing up like many of you suggested but I was sure there was an attendance sheet so I thought of another way to go about things. I arrived at the picnic about 15 mins early when everyone was still busy setting up things, found the attendance sheet (or rather booklet) at the sign in table which was thankfully unattended, and discretely rifled through it until I found my name and signed next to it. I then shuffled away to the parking lot, and drove home to spend the rest of the day drinking beer and watching an ungodly number of Narcos episodes. \n\nThe interesting thing is that when I found my name on the attendance sheet I saw that I was listed as belonging to my former, now defunct, department. If the names had been sorted by department it would have raised some red flags but thankfully they were sorted alphabetically so all the departments were jumbled together and I was lost in fray. I'm just one misplaced entry in some spreadsheet or database that someone like me has been too lazy to double-check.\n\nHopefully I get called back for the third and final interview for the insurance company so I can finally leave this job.",

I had originally been hired to work in 2 seperate departments. HRs way of dealing with this was to not assign me to either department, but to create a new department with just one person, me. Each of the departments had eventually replaced the work I did by reassigning it to someone else. Leaving me with nearly nothing to do all day. My only remaining task was a spreadsheet that had to be done weekly and took all of a half hour to complete. Because there were less than 10 people in my department The layoff would not affect me at all. However, they were offering a very good seperation package for those being laid off. In order to get laid off, I had to go to HR and get them to change me to another department so I could be laid off. By doing that, I saved a fellow worker his job and got the sweet seperation deal.

I stopped looking in the food industry like many of you suggested, and turned my interest towards the automotive industry. I applied to my local Honda/Acura dealership for a parts driver position, and received a phone call about 2 days later.\n\nHe explained that position had recently been filled, but they were looking for detailers. The GM and I had a great 15 minute conversation that he later revealed went so well he wanted to hire me over the phone! \n\nWhen I went in for my interview, we hit it off immediately. We spent about 15 minutes actually talking about the job and any relevant topics, and another 45 minutes just having conversation like we’d known each other for years. I was interviewed by both the General Manager and the Service Manager, who immediately recognized my high potential in customer service roles, and has already shortlisted me for a Service Advisor role.\n\nThe work itself has been awesome! The people are so friendly, there’s countless opportunities to learn and gain experience in new areas, the labor is fun and gratifying, the benefits are unlike anything I’ve ever seen and the best part, the hours are SECURE! I work a set schedule with 40 hours a week guaranteed.\n\nI recently took the initiative and spent the last week quietly cleaning/organizing the department I work in on my downtime, as I’d noticed pretty quickly it was all madness with very little system to it. In all honesty, I mostly did it for myself. To make my job easier and by extension, everyone else’s who works with me. Well, yesterday on my day off, the Service Manager sent me a text to let me know that she’d passed through my department, saw everything I’d done over the week, and was very amazed by how great it looked. She said the guys I work with were so appreciative they gave me 100% of the credit without her even having to ask. Then she says that as a token of appreciation, she has a $250 check for me separate from the Christmas bonus we already received! \n\nThis job has truly proved to be everything I could’ve hoped for and better. And I feel like I owe the fact that I even considered the industry to the kind strangers of Reddit! Thank you all again, and Happy Holidays to all of you celebrating!\n\n",

(Idk if this is relevant they also reached out to me first) \n\nI have 3 years of relevant business internship experience\n\nMy sibling is telling me it’s not worth negotiating because 5k doesn’t add much to your pay check. I understand but I am commuting far so that’s at least gas money lol.… I received an offer in June which I declined (because it wasn’t a good fit for me) and they offered me 65k + bonus so I feel like 65k isn’t crazy to ask for.\n\nAnyone have advice or tips on first if it is worth asking for and what I should say in my negotiation email? I never negotiated before.\n\nEDIT: thanks for the advice everyone. Besides my sibling I have no one to ask to get advice regarding this kind of stuff. I’m sorry if my post is pointless but I literally just wanted a second opinion. ** I am obviously grateful for the offer*\n\nAnother edit: some of y’all are insane? Calling me entitled or petty for even asking for another 5k. Or saying I have an ego for stating I have internship experience?? Obviously I know I’m considered entry level. \n\nDuring my interview they were impressed I knew how to use different tools and programs they use. They literally stated that the person who left the position struggled with learning one of the softwares that I will be using in this position. I already know how to use it so that helps them no? That’s the whole reason I thought I deserved a little more. I am grateful, I understand the market is horrible right now, I am not entitled. \n\nAnother edit because I’m irritated- the whole point of me posting here is just to hear others opinion.

      "body": "As the title implies I have been going into work for the past month, sitting at my desk and surfing the web (mostly reddit) or playing computer games silently, and then going home.\n\nSome backstory, I used to work in a department that was quite autonomous within the company and was actually created by my boss who was an associate VP in the company. I was hired directly (circumventing the usual HR procedures) by my boss as an executive assistant because he was a family friend. It was a pretty decent paying job for a recent grad and I was kept moderately busy answering calls, scheduling, preparing presentations/reports, etc. \n\nHowever, my boss was fired last month and the department was shutdown (my company leases office buildings and my boss wanted to start leasing industrial properties as well and failed) so all the coworkers in my department were either let go or reassigned. The problem is that when HR was going through this process and interviewing my coworkers, I was never called to meet with them (probably due to the way I was hired).\n\nWhile my department was being dismantled I kept coming into the office and going to my original desk. The peculiar thing is that when new employees were being moved into my department's area of the building no one was assigned to the executive's office so therefore no one was assigned to the executive assistant desk. The new employees that moved in were mostly overflow from different departments so no one really works together or has the same manager.  It's been a month and no one has really questioned what I do or what department I'm a part of (I can easily deflect any work related small talk), and I'm still getting paid.\n\nI'm pretty certain if I bring attention to my situation I will be immediately fired because I was the specially hired executive assistant to a VP who lost the company a fair bit of money. I have been looking for alternative jobs but all the jobs that I'm qualified for don't pay nearly as much as what I currently make. Also, I would have to actually do work if I got a new job. The only reason I still come into work is that I don't want to throw up any red flags because each employee is recorded entering and leaving the building by scanning their badge.\n\nI'm thinking about riding this gravy train as long as I can before I eventually get found out and fired.

      "body": "This is not the world’s most ridiculous humble brag, but I’ve been excellent at interviewing. Lately I feel as though interviews are less skill based and more vibes based, so I thought I’d share some tips:\n\n1. I had a lot of extempore practice growing up  and have always been able to think on my feet. Ask someone you trust to throw random topics at you and you have to speak about it in 3 minutes. They don’t have to be hard topics, just anything random. This is basically what we do in real conversations, this will help you speak with intention and quickly. \n\n2. Research the company. Thorough research is only needed for in-depth reports or take home tasks, when you do get to this stage don’t forget to look at their competitors with great granular detail. For stage 1s or stage 2s, it can get crazy when you’re interviewing for 5 other places in one week. Here’s what you do- research the company the night before for an hour. Then again 15 minutes before the interview. That’s all you need to sound like you know what you’re talking about.\n\n3. Fuck da police. I don’t do very well with authority, it’s a natal chart problem. This mindset of I know everything I need to know, has always helped me stay at ease. I try to remember, they need me a lot more than I need them. In this extremely transactional relationship, they are the ones handing money out (desperate) for *me*, just a simple person to render services. Just think of yourself as the master of all and you’ll be golden.\n\n4. Make them laugh. Stay relaxed, sit back in your chair, don’t lean in even in a zoom interview. Speak openly and casually. Even if it is a stuffy company, you’ll see the interviewer relaxing with you as the conversation progresses. Don’t be rude, and don’t have an overall impish body language, just very controlled but also relaxed. Your goal is then to make them laugh, at least twice, anything over that is great but 2 laughs minimum is must. People always say talk about your drink, or something new you did, to seem unique that’s all great but someone who makes you laugh in a long day of boring beige behaviour is pretty damn unforgettable.\n\n5. You are the master of your destiny and in charge of the conversation. You control where this goes, you need to take charge. A lot of interviewers don’t know wtf they’re doing, if that is the case, don’t be afraid to cut them off and say “Hi CYZ, I’m being mindful of time because I have a hard stop at ___. I’d love it if I could talk about how my experience aligns with the position, a little bit about your vision for the role and then I have some prepared questions for after. How does that sound?”. This is a chef’s kiss tactic and it works like charm.\n\n6. The meat of the interview. All this is vibes but what will you say to draw them in? Your entire experience doesn’t matter, but must be touched on. There are 2 structures I follow- chronological recounting of my roles followed by the 10 key skills I have that align with the JD, or skills learnt or used at each role aligning with the job spec. Don’t list any more or less skills than what they’re looking for, sounds mad but they will think you’re overqualified and better than them. \nYou must prepare questions before hand, you have to do this or all of this is for naught. 4 questions, specific, slightly obscure and real head scratchers. Absolutely avoid team structure, company culture questions because they’re tired of answering it. If it was important they would’ve mentioned it in the intro already. \nIf the company is very values driven you can ask the hiring manager why they chose this company, BUT THATS IT. \n\n7. Rejection is redirection. You can smash every interview, at every stage and still get rejected. This has happened to me and it can get extremely exhausting and ultimately detrimental to your confidence. Try to remember that you can do everything right, tick every box, commit no error and still fail, that’s not you, that’s life. Get right back up and keep going. Just for reference because this is Reddit, I’m a senior professional and in the past have never needed to “search” or try hard for roles, seamlessly jumped from position into the next. I don’t recall applying for any role except for my first 2 jobs maybe, always been headhunted. I quit a job from hell in October and was unemployed from Dec 21- Feb 14. I applied to some 490 jobs, did over 60 interviews and got to 11 final stages and received only 4 offers spread weeks apart, it was extremely taxing on my mental health. But I kept going. I accepted that the people who didn’t want me couldn’t value real talent and that’s ok. Lots of businesses don’t want excellence, most of them want minions to push around. If someone didn’t hire you, it’s their loss. \n\nAnxiety and nerves are quite common, I get hassled 15 minutes before the interview as I like things to start before time. Give yourself space to relax and try to decompress after each interview. You have the skills they need, that’s why you’ve been invited to an interview. They see something in you already. Make sure you show them you have all it takes. All you need to succeed is to think “I love to speak, I am about to speak, everyone here is trapped and has to listen to me. I may sound stupid, but they’re the idiots being paid to listen to this mania unfold.” \n\nWould love to help any marketing, ops, comms, pr professionals, prepare questions.\n",

That seems like such a high-risk, low reward thing to do in my opinion. Yes, you do meet clueless recruiters that yap for ages on end at times, but if I was on the other side of the table and choosing between candidates after a round of interviews, you can be sure that I definitely wouldn't think very highly of that one schmuck that cut me off and reminded me how to so my job. \n\nYes, know your worth.

Just accepted an offer, where, in the interview, the managing director asked me if I had anymore questions and I straight out said, “when do I start?” and made her laugh.

      "body": "First you have to figure out what type of job you will be satisfied with at the moment and hope there's an opening for it.\n\nThen you have to either have previous experience or hope they're willing to take on people without experience and train them.\n\nThen you have to fill out the application and hope you were one of the early ones that filled one out and hope they like it.\n\nThis is where the fun starts. You have to hope you don't get ghosted, they don't find someone or enough people before you who also applied that they rather have, or they didn't like your application but couldn't be bothered to send you a message letting you know that.\n\nIf you've made it this far chances are you're at the interview process. First you have to hope you have a real interview set up. \"Wait, there are fake interviews?\" Yes, because some idiots thought the job application process wasn't annoying enough, they've decided to set up apps that schedule you on false interviews. These are \"interviews\" where the hiring manager doesn't know that you were scheduled to have an interview even though that's what the dishonest bot on the app said and you have to hope they give you a real interview instead of turning you away, wasting your or your transportation's gas and time. That's right all of us don't have our own cars because cars cost money which you earn from jobs like the ones we're trying to get in the first place, so we have to get others to take us to interviews and if you think the applicant is really pissed off by this bullshit, just imagine how much their transportation will be when they're not even the one applying for jobs.\n\nHowever, if you were blessed with having a real interview don't fuck it up. You need to know what to say in a timely and non awkward or guessing manner. If they ask anything like \"why do you want this job\" as tempting as it may be to say something like \"I need money because that's how I have to pay my bills, buy food, etc\" that's not what the interviewer wants to hear even if they know that's basically the truth. They want you to come up with some fantasy land response like \"I wanted to work here because I thought it would be a wonderful employment experience and I would be a valuable asset to your team.\"\n\nNow you play the waiting game if you weren't told you got or didn't get the job immediately after the interview. Even if you think you did good in the interview, life can still say \"fuck you\" and you'll be passed up on the job for some reason that the interviewer probably won't disclose if they're a POS. Also if they tell you to wait up to a week to hear back or call them back, chances are you're not getting the job.\n\nHowever, if you do get that \"golden ticket\" of a call/text/email from the interviewer saying you got the job, congratulations. Now you can spend 8 or more hours of your life working so you can buy stuff that you need or want and come back to reddit or other social media sites and read posts about other unlucky individuals who were originally in your position, complaining about the same hell you had to go through to get a job.\n\nThis is the reality for a majority of people in this country when it comes to getting a job and the fact society just accepts it is asinine. Why are we expected to jump through almost endless hoops just to waste our time somewhere we probably don't want to be just so we can live a decent life?\n\nNot to get political, but if a candidate took this into consideration they would easily get my vote.\n",

Honestly, if I had been the one to show up 20 minutes late, I would have been rejected on the spot, no questions asked. Punctuality and respecting people's time are a huge deal for me, especially in my field. It should be a two-way street, right?\n\nI felt this was a massive red flag about their company culture. So I replied to their email. I was polite, told them I appreciated the apology, but informed them that I was no longer interested in the position and wished them the best in their search.

They were superficial and overly simplified answers.\n\nFor example, we might ask him a general question about how he would architect a certain system, and he would respond with minute details about how to configure a specific Windows service, It felt like ChatGPT latched onto a wrong word he typed or understood something completely different.\n\nI'm also not 100% sure, but does anyone have an idea how I can find out how a recruiter interviews applicants?

Many people say 'No, thank you' or just ask about the salary, and by doing so, they miss a very good chance to make themselves stand out.\n\nThe question I like to ask is: 'If we look at the most successful people on your team, what are the most important common traits or habits among them that make them so exceptional, compared to someone who just does what is required of them?'\n\nHonestly, this question achieves two things. First, it shows that you're not just looking for any job; no, your goal is to be among the top performers on the team. Second, their answer literally gives you the manual on how to succeed in that place and what pitfalls you should avoid.\n\nThe feedback I've received for this approach has always been very positive, and I wanted to share the idea with you. I actually got this tip from a career blog a few years ago, and ever since, this question has been with me in every interview I do.\n\nrecently i discovered that companies not search for suitable employee only  they search for suitable employee for their work enviroment to fit with their enviroment easily ..I came across a quote in [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/interviewhammer/comments/1nbkxw8/a_reminder_most_interviewers_are_hiring_a/) says  Most interviewers are hiring a coworker, not a resume ..this not mean that resume is not important but if you reach an interview, and you have an acceptable resume, you should standout even by  asking a good question like what i did ",

And yet, I wasn't able to use your experiences to answer.\n\n\\*I got the 'are you looking at other jobs' question! Your responses were sort of 50/50 on what works. I ended up saying I wasn't comfortable with the question. She said she just was asking the question because their timeline was longer. Why wouldn't she say that?\n\n\\*She asked a question I didn't understand. She wouldn't clarify. I answered something and then asked if I was answering her question. She said she just asks open-ended questions and writes down what people say.\n\n\\*The kicker for me was that she told me next steps would be 2 or 3 other interviews and 3 references were required. She told me I'd be forced to have my last manager be one reference and then I could have two others. After, I started having a panic attack because I can't have my former manager as I quit since she was abusing me and it just brought me back there and how she was lying and sabotaging my career in official channels. I know that if I got to that point, I could tell them something and just give my standard 3 but she was just so bad and I am apparently still so traumatized that I was fucked up for about 20-40 minutes after.\n\nI'll say in doing my research on the department, it turned out she was a recruiter and I found out she actually TEACHES HR!!!! She's one of those early career folks but damn I feel bad for her students. I've had some lovely recuiters, and others that aren't great but I'm able to turn the screen into a good experience that hopefully helps them be better at their job. This one though. Ouch.",

I have honestly just come away from the meeting absolutely kicking myself. Every part of the feedback was skills or experience I have, but I just failed to be able to convey it correctly in the interview.\n\nThe feedback was:\n\n* I used the term \"we\" a lot instead of the term \"I\" so it was hard for them to understand what role I actually played in my examples. I think this stemmed from a learnt habit from my previous role as it was a smaller team. We always used the term we for any of our work, even if it was an individual achievement. It was drilled into us that we were a team and we achieved as a team. Super interesting point, something I'll actively work on for future interviews\n\n* I was told I didn't convey enough interest and enthusiasm for the company and I needed to research the company more in the future. So incredibly frustrated over this as I spent 2 weeks reading everything I could possibly find. I just obviously didn't convey my knowledge as well as I could have. I think the nerves really did just throw me. \n\n* I was advised my answers reflected more of an administrative role over a senior role. She provided a list of things the role did on an every day basis that I needed to be able to do. Again, I'm just kicking myself as EVERYTHING she listed, I did every day in my last role. Again, I just didn't present this well enough. I'm just so disappointed in myself for this as it truly was a mistake on my part. It was all in my resume, but I just couldn't get the point correctly across verbally.\n\nI'm glad I did the follow up chat as I can really see how the nerves just got the better of me. It confirmed for me that I did have the correct experience and ability for the role, but I need to work on how I can really get this across verbally in the future.\n\nJust for information for anyone curious, this was an Australian government role. Talent pools are a normal part of government agencies. However, you normally get offered to go into a talent pool if you were a close runner up for a role, but didn't get it. They just were doing it in a completely different way this time. \n\nThank you again for everyone telling me to take the feedback and grow from it. I took notes in the meeting and thanked the hiring manager for providing the information. I've got a lot to work on but hopefully I'll be able to get an even better role in the future.",

      "body": "I went through a long interview process over the last two weeks. From the beginning, they told me the salary was 70k a year. I did 3 interviews and a skills assessment test that was very difficult and took me about half a day. Today, they finally sent me the offer, but they said due to 'internal adjustments,' the new salary is now 60k.\n\nThis is a very big difference, and it's almost the same salary I make at my current job. Honestly, I'm not sure if it's worth leaving my job to go to a place for the same salary. The only real advantage is that the new job has two work-from-home days a week instead of going to the office 5 days, which is nice, of course, but not to the extent of a 10k difference.\n\nThe situation is very frustrating. I feel like this move is not okay at all, for them to change the number at the last minute like this. Should I even try to negotiate with them to get back to the original salary, or is this a big enough red flag that I should just walk away?\n\nEdit: They don't even know what my current salary is, so I have no idea why they would lower the offer by this much.\n\nEdit2: Money is very important, but if the money difference in the two choices is small enough, other things may factor in.\n\nAnd, as a final comment, I’ll say cutting pay by almost 10% from what was discussed in the interviews vs the offer would have me a bit concerned about the opportunity. Sounds a bit like a bait-and-switch and would cause me to wonder what other surprises are in store.\n\nI will wait for their response, but I will not proceed with the $60,000 regardless. I will go back to applying for other jobs, but has anyone noticed that salary ranges are in a complete decline? \n\nI don't think this is even enough to live on.

I told him, 'It's clear you're not following the market at all. These layoffs are due to company mismanagement, not a flaw in me or the value I added to my teams.' I then told him that based on our conversation, I was withdrawing my application. Then I immediately hung up. Honestly, it felt amazing to finally stand up for myself like that.\n\nUpdate: Thank you to everyone for posting their support and their experiences. I’m in between trying to calm myself down and wondering if it was the right move, given how tough it is to come by an interview in this job market. I will say it was satisfying to burn that bridge. For all those who have had terrible experiences with hiring manager and their teams, I hope that you land at a better place.\n\n\n\nUpdate 2: I did email the recruiter to tell them about the experience. They asked me to hop on a quick call to discuss. They apologised for the interviewer’s behaviour, and that they would remind their hiring team to stick to the assigned questions for candidate assessments. The recruiter explained that the assessments were made to provide an equal assessment of candidate's ability to do the role. I’m glad there are recruiters out there that care and try to make job searching fair for everyone.\n\n\n\nFinal Update: Got the rejection email today, not a surprise.

Will the behaviour ever go away? Probably not. But just once it was nice to stand up and push back when so many times we get beaten into the corner and we accept it because we have no choice. Today is another day to apply to jobs and the world moves forward despite the anxiety of not knowing when or if I’ll ever find a job, but as long as I can I will keep trying. Be kind out there or at least don’t be that asshole today or any other day because someone may just tell you off.",

At the time of course, because the roles were literally identical just in different departments. He also shared that to avoid biases they also typically have 3-5 rounds of interviews with different people in the company. Now we’re at 12. \n\nThis is where I come to ask for advice on what to do. My friends are saying walk away or that I’m just part of a social experiment to see how long I’ll keep saying yes. I on the other hand, as much as I’ve hated the amount of time and effort, have genuinely enjoyed talking to the interviewers and have had a lot (lol) of really good conversations with them. I’ll also add that this is a hybrid role, I can commute via train on in days to save miles on my vehicle plus it’s faster than me driving, benefits are wild and it’s $170k a year. I know it’s not all about money but between that and work life balance as being discussed, there are reasons why I’m still going through it. \n\nI don’t know Reddit, am I crazy? Am I part of a sick social experiment or should I confirm the ‘final’ interview?\n\n**edit/update** holy this blew up more than I thought!! Thank you all for your advice and comments.

Layoffs still seem to be happening left and right. So, please give yourself some grace and patience when applying. Dont beat yourself down and give yourself some space to breathe. \n\nSecond, make a pitch of yourself truly telling your story and what makes you YOU! (As cheesy as this sounds, make yourself unforgettable... this will take practice and lots of different scripts/pitches)\n\nThird, if you get to the HM stage, I highly reccomend ending the interview with asking this Question and this Statement:\n\n1) \"After reviewing my resume and have gotten to know me a bit in this interview. Are there any concerns you may have about my experiences or ability to successfully meet your expectations for the role?\" [GOT THIS FROM REDDIT TOO!!]\n\n2) \"I wanted to express how excited I am to be interviewing with the COMPANY and this is easily my top choice among the companies I’m interviewing with because XYZ\"\n\nFourth, follow up with every interview. Whether it's emailing  the recruiter of how it went, or sending a LinkedIn connection to the interviewers, always thank them for the interview and conversation. \n\nFifth, it's basically a numbers game. Apply, apply, apply! (But don't burn yourself out)\n\nFinally, consider which jobs your applying to and apply to some that you know that are slightly overqualified for.\n\nGood luck everyone!!",

About holding back tears every time someone said, “You’ll find something soon.” About trying to sound confident in interviews while barely holding myself together.\n\nMy job landing long journey:  \nIn the first 8 months I sent out over **1200 applications**, most of them blindly. One resume, no strategy.  \nI applied to roles I barely understood, clinging to the hope that maybe someone would give me a chance.I got **5 interviews**. One turned out to be a sketchy company. Another was an info session where everyone else was over 60. By the end of August, I was mentally drained and questioning everything. So I paused everything, not because I gave up, but because I knew I couldn’t keep going like this. I wasn’t just unlucky, I was unprepared. So I started over, I built 6 tailored resumes based on real job descriptions, and reflected on what I actually wanted, and what I was doing wrong. That short break changed everything. I got **23 interviews** in another **582 applications**. Mock interviews? Daily. Resume rewrites? Constant. Self-doubt? Always, but I kept going.And finally, one day, a real offer came in. I cried harder than I expected.\n\nTools that helped me get through:  \n**Interview Prep:** [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com): check out real candidate experiences, help me know what to expect and company's reviews. [AMA Interview](https://www.amainterview.ai/?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=Reddit+Post&amp;utm_campaign=storytelling): check real question lists, predict interview questions based on my resumes and specific company roles.  \n**Job Boards:** [Indeed](https://joinhandshake.com/): Better response rates for small/mid-sized companies. [Handshake](https://joinhandshake.com/): Got my first internship here. Better for students &amp; startups. LinkedIn: Better for big names &amp; middle-sized companies  \n**Resume Customization:** ChatGPT: Helped me tailor resumes for each job based on their job descriptions.\n\nI almost lost count of how many times I got ghosted. How many interviews I thought I nailed, only to be met with silence. How many nights I stayed up questioning everything I’d done up until now. But the biggest thing I learned? **You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to be persistent and strategic.** If you’re in the middle of it:You are not failing. You are not alone. This market is unforgiving, but that’s not a reflection of your worth.Keep going. If I can get here, through all the noise and pain, so can you. ❤️",

      "body": "I see so many posts from people going crazy over a job they interviewed for weeks ago. Folks, you have to stop doing this to yourselves.\n\nLet's be honest: you're likely their backup plan. They're waiting for their desired candidate to accept the offer. A company that truly wants you moves quickly because they don't want to lose you to a competitor.\n\nSo when you find yourself in complete silence from them, you have a few options. Here are 4 things you can do:\n\nWithdraw your application. Send a polite but firm email stating that you are withdrawing your candidacy due to the lack of communication. Honestly, if more of us did this, maybe recruiters would understand that this stalling tactic isn't okay.\n\nForget about them completely. Don't bother sending another follow-up. Channel that energy into finding a company that respects your time.\n\n(This is a risky move) Use another job offer as use. Tell them you've received a competing offer and need a decision from them by a specific deadline. This might pressure them into making a decision. But be prepared for them to say no, so don't make this move unless you're truly ready to walk away from this offer.\n\nSend one last, brief follow-up. Ask for an update on their timeline. If they don't answer within 48 hours, you have your answer. Consider the matter closed. You have to value your time and mental health. Don't let a silent, unresponsive company live in your head rent-free. I hope this helps someone.\n\nNote: This specifically applies after you've already had an interview. If you've just submitted your application into the void, that's a whole other story.\n\nEdit: Keep applying until you’re actually on day 1 at a job. Shit, maybe even 2-4 weeks after you’ve started, because these companies have no shame and may trash you after 2 weeks\n\nThis is the way. Everyone should move on before you even get to that [first interview](https://interviewhammer.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=interviews&amp;utm_term=7a&amp;utm_content=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Finterviews%2Fcomments%2F1opi4j8%2Fmy_rule_if_a_company_disappears_for_3_weeks_after%2F).\n\nAlso, it's not ideal to withdraw your application or otherwise make your displeasure known. A new position might open up there in the near future that you'll want to be considered for. Plus, if you really want a job, does it matter if you aren't their first choice? Years after I was hired for the longest most stable job I've ever had, I learned that I only got it after their first choice turned it down. But I made lots of great connections and ended up excelling in the position, so it turned out to be a win for everyone (except the fool who turned it down). No shame in being the runner-up!\n\n\n\n",
