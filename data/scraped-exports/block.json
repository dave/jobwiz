      "body": "Worked at a small company for 2 years as an admin. My supervisor was the only person above me, the rest of the crew was warehouse employees, warehouse supervisor and manager. The warehouse is a rotating door of employees, most just walk out some stop showing up and block out number. I've been stressed, overwhelmed, underpaid and overworked. Mentioned it to my supervisor, asked them to hire someone and they saod back in July they would hire another admin. I requested 8 days off since July (from Aigust 2020 to July 2021) and denied all but 2. I can't take off when my boss goes on vacation (or the weeks before or after) of which she's going away two separate 3 week vacations in June &amp; August so basically I'm stuck at work the entire summer. I asked for a raise and was denied. They've interviewed about 10 people in the last few weeks for another admin position and said everyone was too desperate for work.\n\nANYWAY after a few interviews a was offered a new job with a 40% raise, an additional week off, significantly cheaper (and better) health insurance and my few request days off this summer(that my soon to be former employer denied immediately) already approved. Gave me boss notice yesterday. She was visibly PISSED. Said she was blindsided, speechless, \"I thiught you were happy here, why? Just why?\". I said sorry its a significant raise. She told me to leave her office. Came back to my desk a few minutes later and told me I need to stay for an additional 4 weeks while they find and hire someone. I told them I can't. They told me I NEED TO.\n\nTables are turned and I now know how much they need me abd I don't need them. I'm beyond happy their shitty attitude towards me won't change that. Just wanted to share with everyone\n\nEDIT: Walked out with all my shit after my shift Friday. Debating not showing up next week. Fuck em right?\n\nEDIT #2: Payday is Monday. I got paid Saturday morning. Should I take this as a hint?",

      "title": "Please don't neglect your communication skills in favor of improving your leetcode skills",
      "body": "One thing I found that doesn't appear enough on this SR is communication. I tend to see any variation of \"Is this offer good?\" or, \"Why do I have to grind leetcode?!\". Most of the on-the-job posts consist of \"I am in a toxic environment\" or \"Should I change jobs?\"\n\nI have a piece of career advice for anyone who is fairly new to the field that I think could prove helpful. \n\nFirst, a little about me as while I'm not going to hinder my anonymity I do feel I'm in a position where I can rightly prescribe advice to newer SE's / grads / those still school: I'm a Principal Engineer, and have a wide array of experience across operations (including release / implementation) as well as experience developing user-facing code, and internal tooling used organization-wide. I've worked in the DOD, networking space, e-commerce, and fin-tech. \n\nJobs I've held include:\n\n* Software engineer (senior/staff/principal)\n* DevOps Engineer\n* Lead DevOps engineer\n* Lead Site Reliability Engineer\n* Tech Lead\n* Software Development Manager\n* Director of Operations\n\nOne of the greatest skill deficiencies I see in engineers has always been communication. Communication is a very important part of our job. It allows us to promote our ideas, defend our solutions, play the Devil's Advocate, request help, refuse help, patronize others as well as compliment them. We can use communication to self-promote or self-deprecate. Communication literally sets us apart from every other species on this planet; that's not to say other species can't communicate, but that you won't see one chimpanzee explaining to another what the functional use of a blow-hole in Blue Whales is after explaining the nuances in their childrens' respective behavior while foraging for food. \n\nHere is a hard reality for many engineers: ***Even if you are the best software developer at your entire company, getting others (employees, external customers, internal customers) to actually use what you wrote is a different beast than writing a tool.***\n\nHere is another hard reality: ***Many tasks rely on others to \"un-block us\". There are of course times when the blocker is stubborn enough that solid communication doesn't help, but solid communication never hurts.*** \n\nIt's not uncommon for a developer to feel like a priority queue that relies on other priority queues which are poorly optimized, and plagued with race-conditions. \n\nBelow are some points I'd like to make on the subject of communication:\n\n**Being direct is not mutually exclusive with being polite**. I often find overtly rude people fall on the \"I'm just direct and straightforward!\" excuse as though it actually is an excuse for their rudeness. Consider different ways to say the same thing. This SR, and many others, while not inherently controversial (rudeness is often derived from controversial topics), is plagued with what I'd call \"direct rudeness\". Most of us who have posted here at one point or another have been faced with someone who disagreed but failed to do so in a way that made us feel any productive discussion was possible. \n\nConsider the following two versions of the same sentence (email threads I've actually witnessed, redacted of course):\n\n&gt;Hello \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, you are writing a tool that duplicates work done in a tool I've already written. You need to do a better job of communicating what you're working on so we aren't constantly creating duplicate work and wasting time.\n\nHowever, consider had it been structured slightly differently:\n\n&gt;Hello \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, I noticed you're contributing to a tool which I found here(assume a link to source). I'd like to learn more about your specific needs and perhaps discuss whether $TOOL\\_I\\_ALREADY\\_WROTE would fit them, and if not perhaps we could discuss continuing your thread of work towards enhancing the existing tool-set by adding any features you find it's lacking, as there is certainly some overlap. It'd be great if we could avoid duplicate efforts and enhance a tool that's already in use by the organization. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nBoth sentences communicate the same message, but the former puts the recipient on the defensive and immediately raises a few barriers in their mind. Upon receiving it they will be texting / chatting most of their close-colleagues about what a jerk you were. You turned your potential meeting on the topic into a street brawl instead of a discussion. Sometimes it can work out, but why cause additional stress? \n\nI'd argue that the second version of the sentence still gets the point across but puts the recipient and relative ease and opens a dialogue. To expand upon it a bit more in the second version we acknowledge that the recipient is writing a tool, and raise the concern on the overlapping functionality of that tool with an existing one. The purpose of the email is clearly stated as a goal; avoiding overlap. It's not an accusation but a goal and the use of 'we' puts a collective goal in the recipient's mind. Closing with \"Let me know your thoughts.\" opens a dialogue whereas the over-directness of the first version never actually indicates any interest in a dialogue or common goal.\n\n**Everyone is busy, even when they aren't.** We all need things from colleagues, and some colleagues are naturally more busy than others, and some seem like they're never actually working on anything. It's not our job as developers / individual contributors to judge another's workload (and if it is you should evaluate your company's situation). Many things are cyclical and you may be faced with situations where you need a thing done by someone you do not particularly enjoy working with. I have found strategies in communicating with such people that have been effective, for the most part. \n\nPeople love when you acknowledge \"how busy they are\" even when they aren't ever really busy from your perspective. Consider two people asking you for help:\n\n&gt;Hey \\_\\_\\_\\_, can you please do \\_\\_\\_\\_ for me? This is very urgent and blocking $IMPORTANT\\_THING.\n\nConsider that your $IMPORTANT\\_THING isn't always their $IMPORTANT\\_THING. Your emergency isn't always theirs. In a company that is unified it certainly should be, and we should all be empathetic and helpful when we can and have the bandwidth, but it's not always the hand we're dealt. Consider this slight change:\n\n&gt;Hey \\_\\_\\_\\_, I know you're really busy and I'm sorry to bother you! We have an urgent ongoing issue and I'd really, really appreciate it if you could take some time to look!\n\nKeep in mind these are all suggestions and things that have worked for me, but I've had much better luck with using the second version over the first. To reiterate: People love to appear busy. Especially at work. I don't know what it is about perpetually being busy, but it's a badge of honor in our work culture and to not be busy is to not be relevant. ***Also keep in mind that you yourself are not a metric by which to judge people. If you put in 80 hours a week at your salaried job, that's your prerogative. Do not hold that expectation of others.***\n\n**Strong opinions are still opinions.** This one is very relevant in our field as there are many subjects which are inherently based on opinions which draw a lot of controversy. Spaces vs tabs, programming syntax, which language to use, which tools to use, log formatting, etc.. Sometimes we're opinionated about the problems that need to be solved. Do they need to be solved? What's the reason we're solving it?\n\nAlways be self-aware of when you're prescribing your opinion vs. when you're prescribing factual-based information. Pick your battles. If you like tabs, and the project uses spaces, that is not the battle to pick. It's not even really worth a mention unless you can do it without being a jerk. If you want to prescribe your strong opinions onto others then be prepared to back up why you wish to do so.\n\nI recommend being objective, always. Do not make statements that cannot be backed up with other objective statements and explanations.\n\nIdentify why you're so strongly opinionated. Can you present your opinion in a way which shows it derives some mutual benefit?\n\nSometimes one opinion can be stronger than another opinion but this is usually rooted in **facts or history.** For example, the spaces vs. tabs talk is inherently based on opinion. If you walk into a project which uses tabs, and you are a spaces person, you ***do not just reformat the whole project to spaces. This will only make you appear to be an asshole.*** This is also a case where your ***opinion is wrong. Not in that one is superior to the other, but the fact that now when I run a diff in SCM across to revisions, you just created a shit-ton of change where there actually was none, making debugging harder and all because you felt your opinion was superior.*** \n\n**In closing -** I just wanted to possibly help some others in their communication style by providing some examples where I saw what I'd consider communication miss / failure, and examples that have personally worked wonders for me. I'm open to any additional input / advice / suggestions that could help others, as well, including if you want to indicate anywhere you disagree with the things I've said and make suggestions I might not have considered.\n\nJust always be aware that if you aren't communicating at your job, something is wrong. If you aren't communicating ***effectively*** then you are going to hit unnecessary hurdles in your career; a career that is inherently difficult to navigate given the constant churn on technological advancement / changes. I highly recommend any new engineer to host as many lunch and learns, and project demos as they can (code you wrote, tools you wrote, etc..) to improve these skills early in their career, as it will pay massive dividends in the years to come. As for written communication, if you are communicating something that feels edgy / difficult, then sit on it for a bit and proof-read / reread it. Pretend you're the recipient and how you'd respond if you received it from yourself. Consider your relationship with the person you're sending to, and how they respond to and consume various types of communication. Always be learning about your peers and learn how to navigate their personalities in ways that increases your success without inhibiting theirs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.",

I always wish I could have found success from my early 20's, but I was just a complete fuck up.  All I did in high school was play Starcraft, Counter Strike and Diablo 2 all day every day until 2-3 am most nights.  I was falling asleep in class most days and I almost got held back a year because my grades were so unsatisfactory.  I thought this was the worst of my addiction to computer games, but little did I know, that was actually nothing.  \n\n\nWhen it comes time to start trying to get my education back on track through community college, I found a game called World of Warcraft (lol).  As you can tell that I started listing my salary progression at the age of 27.  Yeah, I didn't work until then because I was legit one of those people everyone meme'd about dudes living in mom's basement.  I became one of those elitist World of Warcraft raiders that was in a world top raiding guild.  I would practically be on WOW servers for 12+ hours every day and raiding for 6 out of 7 days.  This is all I did coming out of high school at 18 to 27.  I managed to get some good grades in some math classes in college (Math was the only subject I was naturally decent at) but everything else was an F or a D.  Funnily enough, through WOW, I did meet this one guy that knew how to code and would show me some of his work.  I was always very intrigued by some of the addon's and bots he created for some of the games we played.  When I eventually started to really learn programming, he was definitely one of the guys that would help me out understand some concepts, but he didn't have any real industry experience.\n\n\nWhen I was around 27, I picked up a data entry job that paid close to minimum wage.  The company itself had a tech department as their main product was technology based and they had a website and mobile apps.  About 6-7 months in to my data entry job, I had some basic understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, mostly from videos and messing around in text editors.  It was around this time I emailed one of the managers, managers of the data entry department inquiring about entry level dev jobs.  The manager mentioned that at my level, quality assurance might be a decent role to start with, which I agreed with. \n\n\nOnce I started the QA job (mostly manual testing) is when I first really started to understand how developers worked.  I was fortunate in the fact that most of the developers there were incredibly nice and were more than willing to show me what they were doing.  After about 6 months of manual QA work, I started to learn how to leverage Python and the Selenium framework to start building automated tests.  I ran in to a lot of road blocks in really refining the tests as most of the developers never really worked with Python in their day to day job and didn't have experience with Selenium, so I would be stuck trying to figure stuff out on my own.  This eventually ended up me leaving the automated tests behind.\n\n\nI eventually got some renewed motivation learning coding again, but this time iOS development.  I think this was mainly because I had an iPhone and I already had really great relations with the iOS team (If I ever got stuck with concepts, I could poke them for some help).  I realized pretty quickly, despite me really grasping iOS development and even having pushed PR's to the production application, that I was not going to be able to officially slide to an iOS role naturally at my current job.  I took time at home to start developing an iOS game.  I really made sure to make sure that the game was refined and felt complete before publishing.  After about 4 months of development and publishing, I started to apply for junior iOS roles.  I also picked up Cracking the Coding Interview during this time to try and study.\n\n\nI landed 2 different entry level interviews.  One with some referrals from an old co worker and another from a cold application.  I was pretty lucky in the fact that neither asked tough coding questions as at this time I could barely solve leetcode easy.  We mainly talked about my published iOS app and how I designed it and what were some of the technical challenges I had with it.  There was definitely a good bit of iOS specific knowledge testing as well.  Eventually chose the job that had a really great opportunity to build a brand new app from the ground up for an already successful company.  After about a year in to this job, I really started to get a lot of recruiters reaching out to me on Linkedin.  I only really entertained the unicorns/large tech.  I was OKAY at best with leetcode mediums (Probably solve them at a 50-60% rate), but I always tried to solve them even if I was not actively interviewing.  I knew this skill was the lifeline of getting another job once recruiters started reaching out to me.\n\n\nEventually, after failing a few other interviews, I was able to pass a Big-N interview and was given the 256k total comp offer.  I wouldn't say I was particularly great at leetcode.  I think there was definitely luck involved.  Some coding interviews I crushed while others I failed miserably.  This probably has to do with my comfort level of the types of questions being asked (ie. Array type questions vs graphs).  I will say this, I do not think I'm a shining light of technical capabilities, but I think I do come off as a person people would love to work with.  In general, I'm very polite, friendly, and fairly easy to talk to.\n\n\n**Key Factors**:  \n\n\n - Having a mentor.  When initially learning, I got stuck on a lot of concepts.  I really tried my hardest to figure things out for myself as I generally do not like bothering other people, but sometimes it's just necessary to have someone there to just break down a wall for you\n\n\n - Educational content I went through that I will list below\n\n\n - Getting a published project out initially, so that prospective employers has something they can download and talk about with you\n\n\n - Networking.  Granted, I did have another junior dev offer from a job that was not from any networking, but the job I did choose was from co-workers I worked with when doing QA\n\n\n - Linkedin.  After about a year in to my junior dev role, recruiters from all sorts of large tech companies started reaching out to me.  At this rate, I do not think I'll have to cold apply to most of these guys ever again.\n\n\n**Content I used to self teach (I recommend this in the order I list them for beginners)**\n\n\nHarvard CS50: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM&amp;list=PLhQjrBD2T3828ZVcVzEIhsHVgjANGZveu  \n\n\n(The only paid content I will list) Udemy Angela Yu (Honestly, any course by this instructor will be great.

      "body": "Just in case this would be useful to anyone as a datapoint...\n\n**About me:**\n- US Citizen\n- Graduated in 2022 from an average state school you may or may not have heard of \n- 3 YOE at the time of job hunting, all at one SaaS company in SF (+ 2 internships) \n- Full time experience was all backend development, and I did lead a larger project at my last company so I used that as a talking point in interviews \n- Located in San Francisco, looked to the entire Bay Area for my search. Wasn't open to relocation outside the Bay but that didn't seem to matter thanks to the AI boom... \n\n**Gearing up:**\nTotal time from interview prep to first offer: 3 months (beginning of May 2025 to end of July 2025)\nResources used: Paid for neetcode and the design gurus grokking system design course, and studied them meticulously. Already had LC premium and used that for specific companies. Didn't really do mock interviews because I was an interviewer myself at my last company and already had a ton of practice being on the other side of the table. \n\n**Applications &amp; Interviews:**\nNOTE: All numbers are approximate and may be off by 5 or less, especially for interview counts. I didn't meticulously track everything. \n\nNumber of applications: ~250 sent by me. However, I also got reached out to a lot and pretty much all of my interviews came from recruiters coming to me first, so I can't create a reliable Sankey diagram! I only used 2 referrals from my network and got ghosted by those companies anyway. \n\nMostly targeted full stack roles at mid-late stage startups (Series C+), with the occasional big tech interview if they reached out to me first. \n\nHad 35 recruiter screens -&gt; 32 first round interviews -&gt; 14 second round+ interviews. Many of the first rounds were during my first few weeks studying, I used them to get my feet wet and didn't stress too hard over rejections. \n\n14 second+ turned into 2 offers, 5 rejections, and I canceled 5 final rounds &amp; 2 first rounds myself after signing. \n\nI had ~100 individual interview blocks total, according to my calendar. (not 100 companies, 100 interviews). \n\n**The offer I took:**\n- Series D unicorn healthcare startup, fully remote in SF Bay Area (with the option to go into the office whenever I want, or not.) Big upgrade over my previous hybrid job!! \n- Mid level / level below senior \n- $195,000 base salary ($20k raise over previous job), and some ISOs that I don't consider real money. \n- Full pivot into full stack from my previous 100% backend role\n\n(The other offer was $200,000, upleveled from junior to midlevel and hybrid in SF, but it was SaaS and I was tired of SaaS, plus they told me some stuff about the future direction of the company that I didn't quite like.)\n\n**Insights &amp; Tips**\n1. I got asked a lot less Leetcode and a lot more \"practical\" coding, like writing API endpoints, parsing JSONs, and even writing basic websites from end to end.\n2. Around 3-4 interviewers encouraged AI use during the coding interviews. \n3. LinkedIn pushes recently updated profiles to the top of recruiter searches, so every Sunday I would log in and make some minor change to my profile like adding a period, changing a word, etc. Then I would wake up on Monday with a full inbox. \n4. I went back and replied to all the recruiters and startup founders that had emailed me in the past 6 months. Some were still hiring, others weren't. One very kind startup CEO still chatted with me for 30 minutes and offered to pass my resume on to his founder friends, nothing came of it but he gave me good advice anyway. \n5. I interviewed on top of my day job by doing interviews 8-10 am, working 10-5, and then interviewing again 5-6. I didn't take a single \"sick day\" which I'm super proud of lol. Companies with an East coast presence were open to interviewing me as early as 7 am.\n6. As for how I pivoted to full stack with little to no frontend experience, YOLO I guess? The project I led had a small amount of frontend, and when I had fullstack interviews I did React crash courses and followed along. I got to the point where I knew what to look up for frontend, because most interviewers let you Google stuff on the spot if you look like you know what you're talking about, and just need to double check something etc. ",

      "body": "Hi everyone.\n\n23 years ago I started my programming journey and this year I have worked as a programmer for 15 years. During my career I've seen the hiring process of several companies and I've read stories from candidates, both good and bad.. In the last 8 years or so I myself have been very active in our recruiting process and doing technical evaluations and interviews.\n\nWhen I hire someone, I don't care if you can invert a binary tree, write a bubble sort on a whiteboard or god forbid, \"do the fizzbuzz\". \n\nIf you send someone a code test that takes 3 hours or more to complete, and that person has 10 other job offers and/or applications which also requires a 3 hours or more code test... Why the hell would they even do it? I respect your time more than that. And what if it is a single mother/father, when is this person going to find 3+ hours in the upcoming week outside their current job to complete this assignment to MAYBE get an interview? If you do this, you basically say \"we don't hire single parents\" - or anyone else with similar circumstances for that matter. I expect you to have a life outside of work and I hope it's an awesome one.\n\nDuring interviews I have instead asked them before to prepare this question a bit, which is to talk about a difficult problem that they have encountered and how they went about solving it. Anyone in the team that encountered this problem should be able to answer this question at some level, **however only someone who actually participated in the solution can usually answer follow-up questions** which can require a bit more details, such as \"what made the problem so difficult?\", \"did you try other solutions before the one you ended up with? if so, can you talk a bit about that and why they failed\", \"did you solve it alone or was it a team effort? if you solved it alone, could you talk a bit about the process of how you solve problems? if you solved it in the team, could you talk a bit about how the problem and solution was discussed within the team?\" etc etc...\n\nAnother good thing I have found to work quite well is to use code from a real project and modify it to introduce formatting errors, logical errors, comments that are not needed, logging out data for no reason, missing return statements etc. And then during the interview we go through the code together and I ask the candidate to explain what the code is doing and not to worry if they don't understand it right away, but if that happens, please think out loud so I can hear how you think. If you have to google, please do! But I want to know what you google and why. If all fails, ask me and I will give you a hint or we proceed to the next block of code.\n\nWhat I care about is your thought process when solving problems. If you are someone who throws their arms up in the air and says \"I don't know this, it's impossible\", we have a problem. If you instead say \"I don't know this, I have to google to find out what the X function does\", that's great!! Never give up, always work towards a solution. I want you to be able to solve problems with the same tools you would be offered if we worked together, Google AND asking me is included in that. However, I prefer that you search for a solution yourself before asking me, and if you are asking me I prefer to give you hints or ask questions back to point you in the right direction to help you discover the solution yourself, rather than giving you the answer. This also allows me to figure out how much help you will need in these areas if we hire you.\n\nI am very curious about how other people are approaching this problem. How do you evaluate candidates without sending them code tests or to do meaningless exercises that does not reflect the real job during the interview while they are being observed?\n\nAlso, if you are not the interviewer but instead someone who has been interviewed. If you had a positive experience, please tell me more about what the company did and why you felt it was positive! \n\nI am also curious what do you WISH it would be like? If you could shape the evaluation of your strengths so that you can display them in the best way possible, what would that evaluation look like?",

Then presented with a project I had to debug to make work, they were working through it with me asking me questions on my thought process, also providing hints.

That left such a good impression for me.\n\nThe final stage interview was really digging into my experience, asking some pop-quiz type programming questions, and asking some more personal stuff (\"where do you see yourself in the future\"..etc). \n\nI got to ask questions too, and was quite happy with the answers.

It *should* feel like the tiniest of hurdles to jump. If there's a reason you shouldn't do it today, it's not because of the principle, it's because literally everyone knows what FizzBuzz is, including the BSers you should be weeding out with that.\n\nI'd counter with a very, very easy test that's maybe based directly on the systems that you use. Like, if you're hiring an Angular developer, \"here's an API, display that on a page, we've built the boilerplate for you so all you have to do is write the component, and you have one hour\". If you're hiring a backend person, maybe you have them write the (again, very simple) API (maybe even only the GET method if you've only supplied them with a connection to a SQL database, for example). \n\nYes, this is super easy. It's not meant to show anything but the very, very minimum level of competence.  This is the whole entire point. You want to weed out the jokers, who unfortunately still very much exist in this industry. Frankly, beyond that the \"fit\" issue, which kind of is the thing you can suss out in an interview (perhaps not with STAR based canned responses though) is the most important thing at most enterprise level gigs.\n\nLike, Amazon can say and do all they want about wanting the new guy to be better at their job than the current team (which strikes me as BS in the first place, but they're a huge corporation and whatever they can do to fight nepotism I guess) but the vast, vast majority of places are only fooling themselves by pretending to be that picky.

Only when i started 2 weeks ago did i learn that my mentor actually lives on the west coast (i am east coast), this person from what i can tell is basically untouchable and has been with the company since it started. \n\nMy mentor seems to actually start work at around 2-3 pm my time  (but shows up for stand up at 1 pm).

Unfortunately my mentor has blocked every single one of those PR's with vague comments that nobody can explain to me why, nor does she want to explain to me.

I pushed a bad PR and commits that caused some issues to an important branch. Nothing in prod was affected but a couple engineers had to spend a day or two fixing my mistake and it did end up being a high priority issue that blocked some people. Mostly everyone was nice except a devops engineer who found the issue and was thorough about letting everyone know in every chat that I was the cause of the block. So its pretty well known to everyone that I messed up big-time. I merged a PR to the wrong branch without getting a review because I thought it wasnt required for this branch. \n\nI wouldnt usually be worried but we did have layoffs recently and I know an Eng2 who did get laid off during that cycle due to \"performance issues.\" So this has me thinking im on the top of the list for the next lay offs.

      "body": "I am a ~~Senior~~ Backend Engineer who has never made it past Junior. I got fucked over by two jobs in a row over the past 4 years which held me back. Its a long story so I'll try to keep it somewhat short (because oh boy there is so much more I could talk about).\n\nThe first one was one I held for 3 years. The company was tumultuous and there was high turn over, and a year into the job, half of the engineers were gone and replaced, and by year 3, I was the longest tenure engineer at the company. When I first started there, we had no titles besides Software Engineer and Senior Software Engineer. 2 years in, they decided they wanted to be more like other companies and decided to implement bands. At this point, I was doing system design, db design, security, re-architecture work, introducing process changes, leading meetings, mentoring, etc. I was pushing to get a promotion, because I was doing way more senior work than other seniors in the company, but I was told that they were making a rubric and had frozen promotions for 6 months.\n\nSo, 6 months go by and we have this new salary/title band system, and we get a new HR system as well. I don't think too much of it until one day I go to submit some time off, and under my profile name, it says \"Software Engineer I\", the lowest title level. I'm stunned and go look at the org chart and out of 40 engineers, I am the ONLY ONE who is a Software Engineer I. I bring it up to the engineering manager and he tells me to just go through the review process and it should be fixed with the new rubric. So review time comes around and I finally get the rubric that I had been asking for for a month, and the new rubric ends up blocking my promotion.\n\nWhy? Because whoever made the rubric decided one of the requirements to go from Engineer I to Engineer II is that you have \"Taken responsibility when your changes were responsible for a critical error\". Problem is, after 2.5 years, I never introduced a show-stopping bug. I was the only engineer in the company who never introduced a show-stopping bug. So apparently, I failed that requirement, so they weren't going to give me a promotion. I ended up getting laid off with a bunch of other people 6 months after.\n\nThen last year, I started working a job that was supposed to be a Senior Engineer position, but even though I did great on the interviews, because my previous position wasn't as a \"Senior\", they wouldn't give me the senior title. At this point, things were starting to get pretty bad with the job market and I was desperate, so I took it. Ended up getting laid off again with people late last year.\n\nNow, with how bad the market has gotten, I am struggling to get any traction. I am one of those devs who truly loves writing software, and I've loved it since I first tried it out in high school just for fun. I'm not the most genius engineer or anything like that, but I truly love it, and its not about the money for me. But these past 4 years have really killed my drive and motivation. Now here I am, barely getting any traction while job-searching for months, and since every job posting out there is for Senior+, I'm getting filtered out of jobs left and right. At this point, should I just \"lie\" (or rather, correct what titles I should have had)?\n\nEdit: To all the people saying \"senior titles don't matter\", go tell that to the ATS's. The market today doesn't care about your opinion on whether titles are meaningless or not, and I know full well that the titles don't mean a practical difference in capability. But its not your opinion or mine about whether titles have inherent meaning (which unfortunately they do in terms of org charts, compensation, HR, and many other ways that are not directly technical). You CAN and DO get filtered out of application processes by titles, and this isn't the kind of market where you can afford to have that kind of opinion while job searching.",

To be honest, in its current state, it looks like some kid took notes in the class in a notepad++. Look out for some templates, nothing fancy or two column shit or lot of graphics, plain and simple but presentable. \n\nI am not a great with aesthetics, still throwing in improvement points. Make sure you show it to someone with little bit of art sense. Titles go left, write bullet points instead of “-“, thin line separator between each secrion, page boundaries extended to 0.75”, etc. \n\nContent:\n\nNow, the meat. For every songle sentence you write, you want to answer the question - “why?”. Is it true for summary/motivation? Yes; is it true for coursework? Yes, etc. \n\nYour language is very verbal. You want to be more professional. For example, summary could be like: 1+ years of experience in full stack development using Scrum and Agile, interested in security and autonomous vehicles. Each of the bullet point under experience needs to answer “why”- you downloaded and uploaded something, what did that achieve? What if you had not done that? Remember, every team member adds value to the task being completed. So if you think there was no immediate outcome of your contribution, dont be afraid to convey overall outcome. There are many articles about STAR pattern, etc, read that and do the needful. One balancing factor- though using whatever pattern- try to be to the point so that sentences are smaller. \n\nYou are using action verbs at the start of your sentences, but see if you could use software related action verbs- developed, designed, programmed, etc. \n\nNext, you want to make a list of keywords important for the job title you are looking for. What I did was to download some of the opensourced recruiter tools, and scan your resume through it- it gives keywords as output. Then scan JD through the tool, it gives keywords - you want maximum overlap between these two sets.\n\nI would put my skills and coursework and education together, as they contain most of the keywords.\n\nIf you feel your resume does not have enough content, do some projects quickly to add to the list or dig the stuff from your past, like participated in 4 hackathons, etc. \n\nAs for your question- of course you can get a good job. Any person who wants something, understands the market, can sell his skills always gets the job they want - A L W A Y S. You are no different, You will get a job you want! In short- get rid of every single self doubt. \n\nKeep coding, no matter what. Think like one day without code drags you behind by 2 weeks. This way you will kill the interviews. \n\nApply a bunch. How many? A byte more than you think you should. For this, learn to search better. I remember when I passed out, i got some script that scraped list of emails through linkedin (recruiters, people using technologies that you can use, etc) and sent mass emails via gmail (had a limit of 500 at a time or day). When you say should i apply to the jobs that i dont think i can do well - of course! Does nt harm to apply to less relevant, but after you have exhausted a quota of relevant. \n\nUse a common sense, read the stuff, apply it, keep track of what advice is being implemented, and track whether it worked for you or not, and do not repeat the same mistakes. \n\nI dont think anyone needs more than this.

Either ways the interviewer said it wasn't important, as the important thing was that I knew how to program. \n\nWe had some javascript questions, mainly about how javascript works, given some examples, done some coding together.\n\nSo far fine. The end of the test was 2/3 questions about CSS. He asked me to say how display:block works and display:block-inline. \n\nThe only thing that came to my head was that one would display all the child elements horizontally and the other didn't. Either way I told him I mostly use flex nowadays and mostly with use align-items, justify-content I can get things done. I said I knew there were a lot more display properties, like grid, table but I haven't used them often. \n\nAt the end we even discussed that I could work in the middleware that was written in C#. \n\nThen the feedback I got, was that I wouldn't advance, because: \n\n“JS part was pretty good. All tasks were resolved. There were some issues with *this*, but the rest was great. Good understanding of event loops. Find duplicates problem was resolved with hints.\n\nCSS wasn’t that great, doesn’t have understanding of selectors specificity. Doesn’t know how inline/block work.\n\nNo experience with Angular.\n\nI wouldn’t say that no Angular experience by itself is an issue. But in that case I expected the JS and CSS part to be great. It is a case with JS, however CSS part is a bit week.”\n\nI got pretty confused. So I could learn Angular since I know how to program, but I coulnd't learn/improve CSS which is a markup language?  \n\nSad thing is I lost almost 2h of my life doing this.",

Those who implement an intern program for a specific reason fade off or retire and those who inherit it don't realize the original point.\n\nInterns/juniors are not your grunts or assembly line workers. They aren't there to just spit out code at a breakneck pace and grind through features and tickets. They are your recruiting pool, your \"farm team.\" You hire younger people who have been trained well and have a good background, appear to have good potential in interviews, and then let them learn and operate. They are not there to be productive for you immediately and seeing it as such is a massive waste. This is your opportunity to scout out your future 10xers, team leads, organizational lynchpin engineers that hold it all together and lead the rest.\n\nWhat should be happening is businesses realizing this is the best time to observe, take note of, and promote ideal candidates rapidly in order to secure them and create \"lifers\" that not only do great work but *identify with the company and product.* Not mercenaries, lifers. What instead happens is these members become an afterthought, a matter of convenience. Generally unsupervised, treated like transient contractual labor, a waste of time for everyone involved. And now more and more businesses are skipping this stage entirely and just trying to pump mid/senior levels and cheap foreign contract workers in, leaving a massive gap in the skill pipeline that is going to be realized in time as they no longer have highly productive, highly integrated lifers in their organization that supervise and guide the rest while improving and protecting the product. If you treat your engineering team like transient mercenaries, you are going to get transient mercenary results: apathy, sloppy rushed code, lack of accountability, growing production issues, broken continuity.\n\nEverywhere I have worked, the obvious standout engineers who held everything together were guys that had been there a long time, usually as interns or juniors. They naturally grew into their role and identity, they weren't jammed in there, they were noticed and promoted to that point. The company I am at now has no one that I can see like this, and frankly, it's because they outsourced 90% of their engineering to distant countries to people who couldn't care less beyond knocking tickets out, have no real recruiting pipeline or continuity, and think they can just randomly hire seniors (like me) to throw at their bullshit and untangle the mess. There is no one that we can go to that is \"the guy\" because there is no one that has been here since draft day, just a bunch of dudes picked out of the waiver wire. We are lost. \n\nSo anyway, if there are any business leaders reading this cautionary tale please consider why anyone ever came up with the concept of an intern or junior in the first place. Yes, you probably aren't getting your full value per $ given they are fresh and unproductive. That is more of an opportunity cost to get to train them in house and scout out the ones that are going to be worth 10x their value per $, the ones who will be wrangling your cheap contractors and making sure production isn't down every other day.

This is true for a supermajority of companies (I've anecdotally been at companies that are exceptions to that rule, but realize they are in fact exceptions).\n\nYou cannot have it both ways and say that these companies should be creating loyalists/lifers while also telling those same developers that the company will drop them without hesitation.\n\n\\&gt; If you treat your engineering team like transient mercenaries, you are going to get transient mercenary results: apathy, sloppy rushed code, lack of accountability, growing production issues, broken continuity.\n\nI've rarely seen good codebases. Really, even when developers are like \"oh let's rewrite this and get rid of the tech debt!\", the code bases produced are still mediocre at best and end up in almost the same state later.\n\nMost importantly, companies (supermajority) don't give a flying fuck about that stuff.

If senior engineers aren't thinking about how to make themselves obsolete, they aren't truly senior engineers. Also, if you're a new senior in a company that doesn't have that stuff, and you haven't made it your priority to make those documents from day one as you learn that stuff, you also aren't a senior. (no shade at you specifically, just a general comment for that situation)\n\n\\&gt; Yes, you probably aren't getting your full value per $ given they are fresh and unproductive.\n\nTbh, the calculation is rarely that you aren't getting full value per dollar. Often it's more about the negative impact that interns have on schedules and capacity. Let's say a developer (non intern) has a total capacity of 10, every intern you hire lowers their capacity by 1. At some point, you end up with developers who have no capacity left to do what you hired them for, because you hired a bunch of other interns that have consumed all of it but cannot produce the results you need. There's a real tradeoff there and companies often go too far in one direction which sours the program for them (and everyone else).\n\nPersonally, I don't believe in internships at all. I would rather classify a developer as junior on a junior salary and set the expectations of them at that level. To say that someone cannot produce results at an entry level capacity means they should not be able to enter (by definition). But, that means more responsibility and less hand holding (which isn't a bad thing).\n\nThe primary skill I see &lt;=junior developers lacking the most, hands down, is the ability to figure something out by themselves. And that's not a skill you will ever learn by having your hand held.",

      "body": "I was rejected but I’d love to see if I can get some honest feedback. I know it’s a lot but I need help because I’m not getting offers!\nPlease take a look.\n\nIt’s a Senior SRE role.\n\n# Patreon SRE – Live Debugging Round (Kubernetes)\n\n## Context\n* Goal of the round:\nGet a simple web app working end-to-end in Kubernetes and then discuss how to detect and prevent similar production issues.\n* Environment:\nPre-created k8s cluster, multiple YAMLs (base / simple-webapp, test-connection client), some helper scripts.\nInterviewer explicitly said I could use kubectl and Google; she would also give commands when needed.\n* There were two main components:\n    1. Simple web app (server)\n    2. test-connection pod (client that calls the web app)\n\n---\n\n## Step 1 – Getting Oriented\n* At first I wasn’t in the correct namespace; the interviewer told me that and then switched me into the right namespace.\n* I said I wanted to understand the layout:\n* Look at the YAMLs and scripts to see what’s deployed.\n* I used kubectl get pods and kubectl describe to see which pods existed and what their statuses were.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2 – First Failure: ImagePullBackOff on the Web App\n* One of the simple-webapp pods was in ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull.\n* I described my reasoning:\n* This usually means the image name, registry, or tag is wrong or doesn’t exist.\n* I used kubectl describe pod &lt;name&gt; to see the exact error; the message complained about pulling the image.\n* We inspected the deployment YAML and I noticed the image had a tag that clearly looked wrong (something like ...:bad-tag).\n* I said my hypothesis: the tag is invalid or not present in the registry.\n* The interviewer said for this exercise I could just use the latest tag, and explicitly told me to change it to :latest.\n* I asked if she was definitively telling me to use latest or just nudging me to research; she confirmed “use latest.”\n* I edited the YAML to use the latest tag and then, with her reminder, ran something like:\n* kubectl apply -f base.yaml (or equivalent)\n* After reapplying, the web app pod came up successfully with no more ImagePullBackOff.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3 – Second Failure: test-connection Pod Timeouts\n* Next, we focused on the test-connection pod that was meant to send HTTP requests to the web app.\n* I ran kubectl get pods and saw it was going into CrashLoopBackOff.\n* I used kubectl logs &lt;test-connection-pod&gt;:\n* The logs showed repeated connection failures / HTTP timeouts when trying to reach the simple web app.\n* I wasn’t sure if the bug was on the client or server side, so I checked both:\n* Looked at simple-webapp logs: it wasn’t receiving requests.\n* Looked again at test-connection logs: client couldn’t establish a connection at all (not even 4xx/5xx — just timeouts).\n\n---\n\n## Step 4 – Finding the Port Mismatch (Service Bug)\n* The interviewer suggested, “Maybe something is off with the Service,” and told me to check that YAML.\n* I opened the simple-webapp Service definition in the base YAML.\n* I noticed the Service port was set to 81.\n* The interviewer asked, “What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.\n* I reasoned:\n* If the app container is listening on 8080 but the Service exposes 81, the test client will send traffic to 81 and never reach the app.\n* That matches the timeouts we saw in logs.\n* I changed the Service port 81 → 8080 and re-applied the YAML with kubectl apply.\n* The interviewer mentioned that status/health might lag a bit, and suggested I re-check the test-connection logs as the quickest validation.\n* I ran kubectl logs on the test-connection pod again:\n* This time, I saw valid HTML in the output, meaning the client successfully connected to the web app and got a response.\n* At that point, both pods were healthy and the end-to-end path (client → Service → web app) was working. Debugging portion complete.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5 – Postmortem &amp; Observability Discussion\n\nAfter the hands-on debugging, we shifted into more conceptual SRE discussion.\n\n1) How to detect this kind of issue without manually digging?\n\nI suggested:\n* Alerts on:\n* High CrashLoopBackOff / restart counts for pods.\n* Elevated timeouts / error rate for the client (e.g., synthetic test job).\n* Latency SLO violations if a probe endpoint starts timing out.\n* Use a synthetic “test-connection” job (like the one we just fixed) in production and alert if it fails consistently.\n\n2) How to prevent such misconfigurations from shipping?\n\nI proposed:\n* CI / linting for Kubernetes YAML:\n* If someone changes a Service port, require:\n* A justification in the PR, and/or\n* Matching updates to client configs, probes, etc.\n* If related configs not updated, fail CI or block the merge.\n* Staged / canary rollouts:\n* Roll new config to a small subset first.\n* Watch metrics (timeouts, restarts, error rate).\n* If they degrade, roll back quickly.\n* Config-level integration tests:\n* E.g., a test that deploys the Service and then curls it in-cluster, expecting HTTP 200.\n* If that fails in CI, don’t promote that config.\n\n3) General observability practices\n\nI talked about:\n* Collecting metrics on:\n* Pod restarts, readiness/liveness probe failures.\n* HTTP success/error rates and latency from clients.\n* Shipping these to a monitoring stack (Datadog/Prometheus/Monarch-style).\n* Defining SLOs and alerting on error budget burn instead of only raw thresholds, to avoid noisy paging.\n\n# Patreon SRE System Design\n\n## Context\n\n* Format: 1:1 system design / infrastructure interview on a shared whiteboard / CodeSignal canvas.\n* Interviewer focus: “Design a simple web app, mainly from the infrastructure side.” Less about product features, more about backend/infra, scaling, reliability, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Opening and Problem Framing\n* The interviewer started with something like: “Let’s design a simple web app. We’ll focus more on the infrastructure side than full product features.”\n* The prompt felt very underspecified to me. No concrete business case (not “design a rate limiter” or “notification system”) — just “a web app” plus some load numbers later.\n* I interpreted it as: “Design the infra and backend for a generic CRUD-style web app.”\n\n---\n\n## 2) My Initial High-Level Architecture\n\nWhat I said, roughly in order:\n* I described a basic setup:\n* A client (browser/mobile) sending HTTP requests.\n* A backend service layer running in Kubernetes.\n* An API gateway in front of the services.\n* Because he emphasized “infra side” and this was an SRE team, I leaned hard into Kubernetes immediately:\n* Talked about pods as replicas of the application services.\n* Mentioned nodes and the K8s control plane scheduling pods onto nodes.\n* Said the scheduler could use resource utilization to decide where to place pods and how many replicas to run.\n* When he kept asking “what kind of API gateway?”, I said:\n* Externally we’d expose a REST API gateway (HTTP/JSON).\n* Internally, we’d route to services over REST/gRPC.\n* Mentioned Cloudflare as an example of an external load balancer / edge layer.\n* Also said Kubernetes already gives us routing &amp; LB (Service/Ingress), and we could have a gateway inside the cluster as well.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Traffic Numbers &amp; Availability vs Consistency\n* He then gave rough load numbers:\n* About 3M users, about 1500 requests/min initially.\n* Later he scaled the hypothetical to 1500 requests/sec.\n* I said that at that scale I’d still design with availability in mind:\n* I repeated my general philosophy: I’d rather slightly over-engineer infra than under-engineer and get availability issues.\n* I stated explicitly that availability sounded more important than strict consistency:\n* No requirement about transactions, reservations, or financial double-spend.\n* I said something like: “Since we’re not talking about hard transactions, I’d bias toward availability over strict consistency.”\n* That was my implicit CAP-theorem call: default to AP unless clearly forced into CP.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Rate Limiting &amp; Traffic Surges\n* When he bumped load to 1500 rps, I proposed:\n* Add a global rate limiter at the API gateway:\n* Use a sliding window per user + system-wide.\n* Look back over the last N seconds; if the count exceeds the threshold, we start dropping or deprioritizing those requests.\n* Optionally, send dropped/overflow events to a Kafka topic for auditing or offline processing.\n* I described the sliding-window idea in words:\n* Maintain timestamps of recent requests.\n* When a new request arrives, prune old timestamps and check if we’re still under the limit.\n* I framed the limiter as being attached to or just behind the gateway, based on my Google/Monarch mental model: Gateway → Rate Limiter → Services.\n* The interviewer hinted that rate limiting can happen even further left:\n* For example, Cloudflare or other edge/WAF/LB can do coarse-grained rate limiting before we even touch our own gateway.\n* I acknowledged that and said I hadn’t personally configured that pattern but it made sense.\n* In hindsight:\n* I was overly locked into “gateway-level” rate limiting.\n* I didn’t volunteer the “edge rate limiter” pattern until he nudged me.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Storage Choices &amp; Scaling Writes\n* He asked where I’d store the app’s data.\n* I answered in two stages:\n1. Baseline: start with PostgreSQL (or similar):\n* Good relational modeling.\n* Strong indexing &amp; query capabilities.\n2. Write-heavy scaling:\n* If writes become too heavy or sharding gets painful, move to a NoSQL store (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB, MongoDB).\n* I said NoSQL can be easier to horizontally shard and often handles very high write throughput better.\n* He seemed satisfied with this tradeoff explanation: Postgres first, NoSQL for heavier writes / easier sharding.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Scaling Reads &amp; Caching\n* For read scaling, I suggested:\n* Add a cache in front of the DB, such as Redis or Memcached.\n* When he asked if this was “a single Redis instance or…?” I said:\n* Many teams use Redis as a single instance or small cluster.\n* At larger scale, I’d want a more robust leader / replica cache tier:\n* A leader handling writes/invalidations.\n* Replicas serving reads.\n* Health checks and a failover mechanism if the leader goes down.\n* I tied this back to availability:\n* Multiple cache nodes + leader election so the app doesn’t fall over when one node dies.\n* I also introduced CDC (Change Data Capture) for cache pre-warming:\n* Listen to the DB’s change stream / binlog.\n* When hot rows or tables change, proactively refresh those keys in Redis.\n* This reduces cache misses and makes read performance more stable.\n* The interviewer hadn’t heard CDC framed that way and said he learned something from it, which felt positive.\n\n---\n\n## 7) DDoS / Abuse Protection\n* He asked how I’d handle a DDoS or malicious traffic.\n* My answer:\n* Lean on rate limiting and edge protection:\n* Use Cloudflare/WAF rules to drop/slow bad IPs or UA patterns.\n* Use the gateway rate limiter as a second line of defense.\n* The principle: drop bad traffic as far left as possible so it never reaches core services.\n* This was consistent with the earlier sliding-window limiter description, but I could have been more explicit about multi-layered protection.\n\n---\n\n## 8) Deployment Safety, CI/CD &amp; Rollouts\n* He then moved to deployment safety: how to ship 30–40 times per day without breaking things.\n* I talked about:\na) CI + Linters for Config Changes\n* Have linters / static checks that:\n* Flag risky changes in infra/config files (ports, service names, critical flags).\n* If you touch a sensitive config (like a service port), the pipeline forces you to either:\n* Update all dependent configs, or\n* Provide an explicit justification in the PR.\n* If you don’t, CI fails.\n* The goal is to prevent subtle config mismatches from even reaching staging.\nb) Canary / Phased Rollouts\n* Start with a small slice of traffic (e.g., 3%).\n* If metrics look good, step up: 10% → 20% → 50% → 100%.\n* At each stage, monitor:\n* Error rate.\n* Latency.\n* Availability.\nc) Rollback Strategy\n* Maintain old and new versions side by side (blue/green or canary).\n* Use dashboards with old-version vs new-version metrics colored differently.\n* If new-version metrics spike in errors or latency while old-version remains flat, that’s a strong indicator to rollback.\n* He seemed to like this part; this matches what many SRE orgs do.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Security (e.g., SQL Injection)\n* He asked about protecting against SQL injection and bad input.\n* My answer, in hindsight, was weaker here:\n* I mentioned:\n* Use a service / library to validate inputs.\n* Potentially regex-based sanitization.\n* I didn’t clearly say:\n* Prepared statements / parameterized queries everywhere.\n* Never string-concatenate SQL.\n* Use least-privilege DB roles.\n* So while directionally OK, this answer wasn’t as crisp or concrete as it could have been.\n",

I'd be a bit apprehensive to hire a senior whose recommendation is \"reliability at the cost of everything else\".\n\n## Too much human reliance\n\n\"A justification in the PR, and/or\"\n\nPersonally, not a big fan of answers that boils down to \"let humans do this X process\". Humans are faulty, and manual processes tend to get ignored over time (e.g. people just rubber-stamping the justification).\n\n\"At each stage, monitor:\"\n\nThis also seems like an extra toil that can be done automatically.\n\nIn general, adding more bureucracy / slowing down development for the sake of needless reliability is also bad, similar to above.\n\n## Seems pretty textbook\n\nOverall, your answers give me the vibe of \"recommend the commonly recommended thing, just because that's best practice, without further thought\", like immediately jumping to k8s, specific DB, and so on.\n\nIn the system design interview, I think I'd personally like to see how you think from the fundamentals and the first principle more, rather than just giving me a list of technologies immediately:\n\n- For a simple webapp, do we \\*really\\* need to use k8s? You're signing up your team to eat a lot of dev / knowledge cost before even hearing the full constraint of the problem.\n\n- Before jumping into the details, why not verify more fundamental things? e.g. do we need redundancy across different regions?\n\n- NoSQL theoretically scales horizontally better, but is that true in reality? In a lot of cases, there is a mismatch between theory and reality. Similar to how linked list are faster than arrays on paper for some use case, but they tend to be slower in reality due to caching performance.\n\n## Random nit\n\n'“What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.' \n\nIncorrect? I'd expect the answer to be 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS. I'd personally shrug it as nervousness / misunderstanding, but maaaaybe there's a small chance of interviewers really disliking it (e.g. \"this person has only ever deployed things on localhost\") since that's a pretty fundamental thing to get wrong.\n\nDon't beat yourself up too much though, interview fails sometimes do just happen randomly (e.g. there just happen to be unicorn candidate right after you). From the post, it seems like you're a pretty strong candidate and the interview itself went pretty well.\n\nI think the core of the issue is that a senior SRE should be someone who knows why we need to follow mainstream recommendations, and when we should not follow them. I'm not saying you don't have that quality, but I think the way you answer the interview questions did not necessarily demonstrate that due to the textbook answer and overemphasis on reliability above all.",

      "body": "I stumbled across this channel and read some of the posts and it occurred to me that there are a lot of questions and opinions being floated but I haven't seen any actionable advice. I have seen some bad advice. \n\nFirst: Who am I? I work these days in technology but I've been a carpenter, I've worked in the marine industry as a boat captain and various scut work jobs, Ive been a graphic designer, and I have been a Product Management leader for 25+ years with VP, SVP and CPO titles. I've worked at huge companies, mid-sized companies and I've founded four companies, two of which I was the CEO. \n\nSo at the risk of pontificating, I thought I'd share some thoughts:\n\nFirst: People are looking for coworkers - meaning people who they like, who are at the same level of *competence* as the rest of the team (not experience), who get things done, who are reliable, and who are creative problem solvers. Even at unsophisticated jobs, being a creative problem solver is a huge plus. You have to come across as likable. And ideally you want the interviewer to start rooting for you to be successful. \n\nSo how do you do that? You have to arrive at an interview ready to tell stories that capture the interviewer's attention and illustrate your value. Most interviewers are not good at interviewing, so you need to help them along. \n\nThese days I screen for 4 things when I hire.  I believe these things are universally desirable and necessary in order to be successful at any job: Grit, Integrity, Empathy and Creativity. \n\nI believe that if you can exhibit and illustrate these four traits in an interview, you have a much better chance of being hired.  So what do these things mean, and how do you illustrate them?\n\n1. Grit:  this is the ability to get a task or project done, even if you run into obstacles. You need to illustrate that you have initiative, that you can identify and solve problems that are blocking you (sometimes this means asking for help, especially if you're junior), but mostly it means you keep on trying even if things get hard. \n\nSo have a story queued up that you can use to illustrate your grit. Tell a story about a really hard problem you had to solve. Summarize the background, explain what obstacles you ran into, and how you solved them. For a first job or if you're junior (1-3 years) telling a story that isn't work related is okay.  Or a situation where you recognized a problem beyond your skill level and escalated to get help from your boss or a senior colleague, and then completed the project. Sometimes showing that you're a team player and that you have the humility to ask for help is better than struggling alone. However, if you're more senior, showing that you know how to get things done independently is probably more important.\n\n2. Integrity: Are you trustworthy and reliable? Illustrate that you have integrity by telling about a time you had a moral or ethical quandary and had to make the hard decision to do the right thing. Or if you're brave, a time you did the wrong thing but learned from that failure. To be clear, I'm not talking about a time you made a mistake, I'm talking about the time you failed, the time you did the wrong thing, you knew it, you made the decision, and faced some consequences. Of course it's important that if you go down that path that your focus is on what you learned and why you won't make that mistake again. This can be really important if you have anything in your background that could become visible through a simple social media search or background check. Showing vulnerability in an interview, especially around integrity, can be the thing that gets an interviewer to start rooting for your success. \n\n3. Empathy: This is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, walk around, see things from their perspective, and make decisions based on that insight. I would tell a story about a time when you struggled to work with someone else, perhaps you didn't even like that person, perhaps you disliked that person. But then you suddenly had an insight into why they were acting the way they were, or what was driving them, you developed a sense of empathy for them, and were able to work through the issues. Maybe you forged a great relationship, or maybe you just found a way to get by with a difficult coworker. Either way this will illustrate empathy and the ability to collaborate with people even if they are difficult.\n\n4. Creativity: This one is a bit trickier. When I interview candidates, I ask a question designed to elicit a story about creativity. So be careful about how you interject this in the conversation. Tell a story about a time you figured out a solution to something difficult in a creative way, maybe talking about a business you started, even something as simple as a lawnmowing business as a kid or a project you did at church or a summer project.  I ask the person to tell me an idea they've had for a company or a product or a nonprofit or service and what is exciting about it to them. Then I ask them to think through several aspects of the idea and expand on it until they finally either prove that they can think things through and to end, or they run into a wall at some point. Either way, it's very illuminating as an interviewer.\n\nI hope this is helpful. Just remember, hiring managers are looking for team members. They're figuring out if they like you as well as if you're qualified. So it's really important that you let them look at you, the real you, so they can assess you for who you actually are. I've Filled people out of an interview process because they were too guarded and weren't letting me get to know them.\n\nOne last thing. As much as you are being interviewed, you should be interviewing them. Show up with good questions, do research about the company before you show up, and have a good reason for why you want to work there. If you discover that you don't like the people interviewing you , find out if they are someone you will have to work with every day or if they are not someone you will work with every day. It may not be worth it to take the job if you don't like the people.",

      "body": "As many of you start your last semester or seek out summer internships, I can't help but notice this sub turning in questions about the 'prestige' of certain job, whether or not they should forgo any social/fun aspects of college to focus on studies/side projects, or other questions that mostly involve how they will somehow gain the validation and admiration of their peers.\n\n All these questions, as well as answers coming from the undergrads who have yet to venture out into the real world, are honestly disappointing. The prevalent attitude on this sub is becoming more and more treating this profession as a means to end to be prestigious or gain some lofty standing in some City Upon a Hill (Working at a 'Big 4' company in SF). The future is becoming binary in that you're either living that dream or you're a failure in life. Why? Quit looking to this sub with the question that boils down to 'Should I be happy in this situation?' The only person who can tell you that is you. \n\nOne of the easiest examples is the multitude of 'Which internship would look better if I want to apply to XYZ later'. Suppose some anonymous person on the internet tells you 'Oh, definitely take Option A because I heard Company XYZ likes that better', are you really going to base a few months/a year of your life on the possibility that this person is right and you MIGHT increase your chance?  Any experience is good experience, as long as you can talk enthusiastically about your internship/projects, an interviewer is going to be impressed. \n\nThe further extreme is obviously 'Would taking an internship at A hurt me later on' when the post clearly doesn't have any other options. Please, for the love of god, lets not have any of this in 2016. Stop putting the cart before the horse and enjoy yourself.  As I, along with any other poster who has graduated, has said, any experience is truly good experience. You can spin anything into being a positive work experience. Working at any internship will only help you in the end. \n\nThe same advice goes to full time jobs. There is nothing wrong with wanting to work at any of the buzzword companies that are discussed on this sub. They are great companies with some truly great engineers working there. However, there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of the companies not frequently or never mentioned on this sub. If you can meet all your bills and live a lifestyle that makes you happy, what else is there? It doesn't matter if it's working at a small dev shop in a non-tech hub city or working in downtown of a major city for a top 10 company. Do what makes you happy, the validation of the people on this sub shouldn't matter. \n\nThere is also nothing wrong with working at a company that might not be your dream job. Treat it as though it was though, gain as much experience as you can and at least open up to the possibility that you might be happy there. You can always apply to other companies later on and who knows what the future might hold, but do not treat it as a dead end or a road block to your future life, treat it as an opportunity and take full advantage of it. \n\n**tl;dr** The only person you need to be concerned about is you. If you're happy, who cares what anyone else thinks?",

      "body": "The past six weeks have felt like what I can only describe to be a nightmare.  I have an amazing wife and daughter whom I love more than anything and we live in a modest home just perfect for us, I am a truly blessed man and realize that.  I have worked the past decade or so as a Customer Support Engineer essentially where my primary role was to support an in-market product (data storage arrays) resolving customer issues and working to refine the product and associated recovery procedures, etc..  Anyhow, while I never found this job to be super interesting nor provide much in terms of growth it paid the bills and allowed me to have a lot of free time to spend with my family so I hung out and looking back now never really developed a contingency plan in the event of a layoff, and so here I am.  In the back of my head and from what I generally heard from peers / colleagues is that support jobs are around and generally in demand so always thought I'd figure it out if I had to.    \n  \nMy strategy at least for the first few weeks of this has been to prep as a Software Engineer (my actual job title the past decade) and try to see if I can break into a pure dev role, ultimately I prefer to be in this world however out of college I took a job that I had a good connection with, thinking I'd always be able to make a transition over however that never really panned out.  I did a fair amount of scripting work mostly for tools and process automation through my time as a Support engineer but not enough to make me super attractive to any real dev jobs at this point so my first question is am I wasting my time barking up this tree and should I focus on Customer Support type jobs?  So far I've had a few interviews which I didn't feel like I was too out of place but they have been so few and far between that I'm starting to lose hope in this area.  More recently I've been getting really stressed out and legitimately worrying I'm not going to find a job, not going to be able to pay my bills when my severance time is up and eventually lose my family because I won't be able to cut it in this field and will not be able to support the lifestyle we've lived at and the one I want to provide to them and has been really hard to bear.  Anyways, lately I've been applying more aggressively to anything and everything that looks like a customer support engineer role and started to just get desperate and worried.  It feels difficult to market what my skills are coming from being a Support engineer, we worked cases in a very broad spectrum of technologies and it feels like I haven't really mastered any but am familiar with a ton and just don't feel like I have a good direction, and like I'm getting dragged in a different direction everytime I get a bite for an interview.  For instance I have a friend helping me get an interview for a support role at a company more in the finance realm, this is very novel to me so takes a bit of extra background energy to get prepped for, so everytime this happens I start to wonder if I need to pick one of these fields and just dig into and stick with it?    \n  \nReally just looking for any helpful advice or insight here from the perspective of an parent &amp;| an engineer who maybe has gone through something similar because the thought of losing my family is tearing me up, and my wife really is taking this hard and not someone I feel like I can go to with every detail, failure or worry I have in this process.  My plan is to keep working on coding challenge sites, continue building a full stack application I've been working on, reading system design interview books and a whole lot of praying.  Thank you for any and all help or insight you are able to lend.    \n  \n**TL;DR:**  \n After working over a decade as a Customer Support Engineer, I was recently laid off and am now facing the tough reality of job hunting. I’ve been trying to transition into a Software Engineering role, which aligns more with my interests, but am struggling with limited development experience and wondering if it’s realistic. Meanwhile, financial worries and the fear of not being able to support my family are weighing heavily. I’m torn between sticking with support roles or pushing toward dev work, and the uncertainty is incredibly stressful. Any advice from engineers or parents who have been in similar situations would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nUPDATE:  I'm thrilled to share that I accepted an offer for a role I'm really excited about! For anyone still searching, don't give up. Lean hard on your network, block out the noise, and keep pushing forward. I know it's tough out there, but it's not impossible. Just keep swimming and you'll land where you belong.  Thank you to everyone here for your kind words and motivation. Wish you all the best.\n",

That, and we LOVE our place and our new community. And now I’ll love it even more because of my zero commute!\n\nThanks for all the comments and input. It was a super tough choice, but an overwhelming number of you said go for the $60k/shorter commute, so that’s what I did. Huge kudos go to my super supportive husband without whom I couldn’t live on $60k/year alone as it’s not technically a living wage in our HCOL area. I’ll love the actual work though and will feel that my input and contributions are appreciated, so that’s a huge win. \n\nOriginal post: I’m so torn. I’m facing a layoff but have been offered a $60k/year job basically next door to my house that is supposed to start on Jan 6 (was offered it Christmas Eve). I also have two very promising interviews next week at firms an hour and a half from my home with frightening commutes for $100k a year. I’m a high-strung person when it comes to commute anxiety, the Sunday scaries, and Monday Blues. I think it would do a LOT for my mental health to be next door to my job, even though it’s so much less. Relatives are telling me I’d be insane to basically give up what equates to $120k for every three years of work. What would you do? Is $40k/year worth a three-minute commute? Husband is pro less stress…",

Most interviews I go in thinking “I am not landing this job, I’m just here to learn about the company and talk about myself.” Seems entirely counterintuitive, but it really takes the pressure off and helps me sound more personable. However, some of my peers have been successful with the mentality of “the interviewer should be scared of me.” Taking a pause after the question also really helps; I’ve never had an interviewer give negative feedback on this and you can definitely craft something more coherent than a rushed answer spouted immediately.

Well I didn’t think anything of it at the time and I filled out my info and pics of my ID and my Social ??? Don’t even know what to do about that now.

      "body": "I had been searching for a remote front-end position for 7 months. To be honest, I've been working at a company for the past 10 years, and I was only looking for extra income. So, I wasn't stressed since I didn't need a job urgently, but if I had been in urgent need, I honestly don't know what I would have done. During this process, I started to really hate LinkedIn. Many job postings were fake, which wasted a lot of my time. (I don't understand why they don't block these fake listings.) Because of these fake postings, I had to manually verify each listing on the company's website. This was incredibly frustrating and cost me a lot of time.\n\nHowever, in the last 3 months, I completely changed my strategy. By learning new methods from both Reddit and a friend who works in HR, I began applying these strategies, and that's when I started making significant progress. I also used several tools, both free and paid, during my search, and each of them was helpful in its own way. However, I won’t share the platform details here, as I don’t want this to come across as promotional. In 3 months, I had 12 interviews and received 3 offers. But since I was looking for an additional job alongside my main one, I was only able to accept 1 project.\n\nHonestly, I found the job a month ago, but I didn't want to share it with anyone until I received my payment.(I even shared it with my friends today) I secured a 5-hour-a-day contract (I finish the tasks in 3-4 hours since I work a bit faster), and today, I received my $2,000 monthly salary. (It may seem like a small amount for many of you, but it's more than enough for me.) \n\n**Here are a few tips for those who are still job hunting:**\n\n*  For job postings you find on LinkedIn or Indeed, always check the company’s official website to ensure the listing is genuine. If possible, submit your application directly through the company’s site.\n* Some platforms pull job listings directly from company websites. Regularly follow these platforms to stay updated. This way, you can be among the first applicants. Always apply to new listings through the company’s official site.\n*  There are freelancers who specialize in applying to hundreds of job postings on your behalf. You can find them on platforms like Fiverr or Upwork.\n* Make a list of companies you’d like to work for and check their websites weekly for new openings. If possible, send your resume to all of them in bulk to increase your chances.\n* If you’re looking for an onsite job near your home, for example, as a nurse, use Google Maps to search for terms like \"hospital\" or \"clinic\" in your area. Compile the email addresses of the places you find into an Excel sheet and send your resume to all of them.\n\nI wanted to share my joy with you all. I hope you all find your desired job as soon as possible. Best of luck!",

Neither call was set up nor did I have any indication they would call. The first call was at 7:45am and had no caller ID and from an area code I wasn’t familiar with. I didn’t answer it. I received an email not even 5 minutes after stating they tried to contact me and couldn’t therefore I won’t be selected for an interview. Bull. Shit. I just received another call from a company, at 8:15pm, from somebody’s personal number. Again, weird area code, unfamiliar name, late at night. Didn’t answer.

      "body": "Hello Everyone!\n\nToday I decided to put in my two weeks' notice at McDonalds. My friend tested positive for COVID the day after we hung out. I wasn't feeling well today, so I called out under the impression I had COVID (fever, sore throat, exhaustion). I took three COVID tests: one positive and two negative. Regardless of not having COVID, I still did not feel well. I assume the positive was a false positive. \n\nI usually never call out. I have called out maybe two or three times in my whole two years of working there. I ask for time off in advance. Me calling out was a huge problem today, though! I see people call out all the time for non-sickness-related issues, and they aren't harassed at all.\n\nI called the store, and they told me to text the general manager, so I did. She told me I was required to provide a doctor's note and that in the future, I need to tell her in advance so she can cover my shift. (Side note: I am a minor.) I have known this manager for a while, and she is one bitter woman. I could literally hear her irritated, passive-aggressive tone through the text. Firstly, how am I suppose to tell you I will be sick in advance? Secondly, my regular doctor is closed due to it being a weekend, and my mom was not about to take me to urgent care. We suspected COVID, so she bought more at-home testing kits, but I luckily did not end up having it. Anyway, it was an unnecessary expense for me to go to urgent care.\n\nThis text my manager sent me was giving me extreme anxiety, and my mom told me to wait until she got home to respond, so that's what I did. I started to cry because I knew my GM wouldn't believe me and would talk a lot of crap behind my back. The McDonald's I work at is just such a hostile environment. I decided I didn't want to work at McDonald's anymore because I shouldn't have such strong anxiety about going to work. I told my mom, and she fully supported my decision. While I waited for her, I began applying to jobs. I got three interviews lined up and am still waiting to hear back from other places.\n\nWhen my mom got home, we responded with this:\n\n\"Sorry for the delay, I was resting because I don't feel well. Unfortunately, I will not be able to provide a doctor's note. My regular doctor's office is closed since it is a weekend, and my mom will not be taking me to urgent care because that is an unnecessary expense. When I provided a doctor's note in the past, it wasn't even looked at. She already spent $50 buying COVID tests and NyQuil for me. My third test was negative, so I feel comfortable working my shift tomorrow as long as my fever is controlled. Additionally, please consider this text to be my two-week notice. I will not be there next weekend, Oct 5-6, so my last weekend working will be Oct 12-13. I did my best to be a good employee, requesting time off in advance when known and very rarely calling off a shift. Thank you.\"\n\nShe did not respond but instead called me. My heart was pounding because I was so scared of her yelling at me. That's the type of person she is. My mom answered for me because I was clearly in distress. The call was abrupt, and the GM told my mom to tell me to call her back.\n\nI had full intention of calling her back, but then my friend (who was at work) told me that she put my mom on speaker and was talking crap about both of us. All my respect was gone. She called my mom and me dumb.\n\nNow, when I put my two weeks' notice in, it did not include one weekend because they have known I would be gone that weekend for weeks now. But I did say I would work Oct 12-Oct 13. (Side note: I only work weekends.) After she disrespected my mom, any intention of working those days went out the window. I will not deal with her disrespect and bullying.\n\nI am making tomorrow my last day and not showing up on the days I said I would. All managers will be getting blocked after tomorrow.\n\nI guess my question is, what are the possible consequences of not going Oct 12-13? I did have the intention of working those days, but not after I heard she disrespected my mom. I don't even care what she says about me, but any consideration is gone after you disrespect my mom.\n\nUPDATE(5:30AM): It is the next day and my shift starts at 6am. I am not going to work. I took everyone's advice and am making the assumption I do have COVID. I blocked all the managers and I am done. You guys are right, they wouldn't give me any type of notice if they wanted to fire me. I want to thank everyone for reassuring me and helping me get the strength to not get bullied into going when I feel sick. I really tried to convince myself I'd be okay to work today. Honestly, I know it is horrendously understaffed on Sundays, which is why I feel somewhat guilty... but I made my choice and I quit🤷‍♀️ I didn't really let any of my managers know I retract my two week notice but all of you told me I basically don't have too!\n\nTL;DR: \n\nI put in my two weeks' notice at McDonald's after my manager reacted harshly to me calling out sick due to possible COVID(Have only called out 2 or 3 times over 2 years). Despite taking three tests (one positive, two negative), my manager demanded a doctor's note, which was not feasible due to the weekend. Her response caused me extreme anxiety. After hearing she badmouthed my mom, I decided to make tomorrow my last day instead of working the remaining shifts (Despite giving a two week notice). What are the possible consequences of not showing up for my final shifts on Oct 12-13?\n\n",

      "body": "EDIT: Dad got a job at another beverage company 1.5 months after this post :) thank you all for the help!\n\nI’m writing this because as a daughter (and the oldest child) of immigrant parents, I am expected to have all the answers and I have no idea what to do.\n\nMy father (62M) has been a truck driver for a beverage company for the last 5 years. He always went to work, did his job, came in during days when they were short staffed, and had good relationships with his managers. \n\nMy dad complained about a department store he would deliver to, specifically a lady which is their receiver, we’ll call her Tammy. My dad never told his supervisors about her, but he would tell us that she can be very bipolar sometimes and get demanding with certain requests that my  father can’t complete or whatever. Long story short, Tammy and my dad did not have the smoothest relationship.\n\nMoving forward to April 25(I think), my dad went to deliver a truck to Tammy’s store, and a beer vendor was blocking the entry way so my dad told Tammy he’ll be back so he can make his other stops, Tammy said it was fine as long as he came back by 12pm. My dad discussed this with his supervisor, and got the thumbs up. \n\nDad goes back before 12pm, and noticed Tammy’s mood was VERY off. He did his thing. Tammy requested my dad take back a crate and my dad explained to her he can’t take back just one due to company policy or whatever. Tammy got pissy and started saying stuff under her breath and my dad got a bit defensive. \n\nAnyway, I guess things got a little heated and apparently two other people (who my dad says work with Coke on the sales side) stepped in. I know my dad made a comment to them saying “I’m speaking to Tammy not you please let me talk to her”.\n\nMind you, my dad is a 60 year old foreign man. He has a thick accent, and sometimes his words can come across harsh, not because he means to, but just because of his accent. He can’t find words or formulate them in an appropriate sentence at times, so his tone can be not very nice. I’m not trying to make excuses here..because I can see my dad rubbing off the wrong way sometimes because he has to me before, but…yeah. \n\nWell anyway, he got fired yesterday. He gave a statement as to what happened (my brother (23M) wrote it up) and they handed him a notice they he was out yesterday. This caught my dad by surprise, because apparently when he left, Tammy was fine and in a good mood, called him darling and everything, and my dad really thought he was okay. But the complaint from them still came through and the beverage company decided to let my dad go. Not sure if it was Tammy or someone else that was there that made the report but that doesn’t matter. \n\nAnyway, now, I’m stuck. My dad had the highest income in the family and pays off the majority of the bills with his paychecks as my moms checks are supplemental income and very low. My younger sister is in college, my brother is trying to get his foot planted since he just graduated. And I recently graduated and live in Chicago (parents are in VA)\n\nI guess I’m asking for advice. I’ve been told to ask them to change the reason for termination from being fired to my dad resigning but how likely is this even possible? How do I even approach them about this? \nThey gave no warning to my dad, but I assume they don’t need to since he’s at will? How do I even confirm if he’s at will? Does that even matter? \nMy dad has never received a warning in the past or anything, does that help this case? I mean I really don’t know what to do next. \n\nFinding another truck driving job seems like the biggest challenge right now because how do I (since I will probably be attending his interviews with him as a translator) explain that my dad got fired for that? 5 years at a company man..I can’t even just not include that work history since it’s such a long time. \n\nI have experience helping my dad find a job because in 2008 when I was just 12, my father got laid off. However, because he was laid off vs fired, I was able to answer his interview questions well, and assisted with filing for his unemployment. But now? Like now what.. Can he even get unemployment? \n\nPlease give me any advice. I’m an open book here. \n\nEdit: Yes! Dad has a CDL Class A License.\n\nEdit: No dad isn’t illiterate, but there is a language barrier (and a heavy one at that)\n\nEdit: extending my sincerest gratitude for all of the advice. Every perspective counts, and I appreciate all the insights! ",

It's very noisy to the point that it's stressful and causing pain, the a/c is very cold to the point I'm constantly drinking a hot beverage to stay warm despite wearing long sleeves and a sweater.  The manager was told to take measures to reduce the noise but he refused.  There is a loud slamming door that slams shut several times an hour.

He really flipped his shit when I emailed him the evening before my shift (and scolded me for keeping it from him when my car had broken down a few days prior).  I paid my colleague/trainer to pick me up and drop me off on the way to work and he too is discouraging me from making an appointment with an out of town dealer.  I understand why but I really need a day off to get my car serviced.

Well, it has been 6.5 months since I was laid off and I am at the end of my rope. I need help, too! Below is a condensed overview of my situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Professional Background:\n   * Title: Senior Corporate Communications Specialist\n   * Total experience in Marketing/Communications: 7 years\n   * Total Work Experience: 15 years\n      * I have employment gaps of up to 1 year between my major jobs and have worked jobs that were not relevant to my career to make ends meet.\n   * All of my experience is at Japanese companies and I moved back to the US about 4 years ago.\n   * I specialize in PR, Internal/External Communications, Branding, and Marketing at a Global capacity.\n      * I have no formal education for Marketing/Communications, though I have taught marketing/communications courses in a past career.\n      * I often acted as a liaison between Japan, the US, and Europe, connecting people with the right people within my organization of 40,000+ employees. I wore many hats and it was not uncommon for me to be on meetings with Europe at 6 or 7am and meetings with Japan until 10 to 11pm. 15-hour work days are no stranger to me.\n   * I read/write/speak Japanese fluently.\n      * I do not have any certification proving this, but I did live in Japan for over 12 years and have worked at roles in Japanese companies that require bilingual fluency for 7 years of my career.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I was laid off this April after the company announced their greatest loss in 20+ years of nearly $2B due to a failed acquisition in North America.\n   * I have reached out to my network, all people were happy to be personal references but had no idea any other ways they could help me in my job search.\n      * Most of my network is General Manager to C-suite. They are extraordinarily busy people.\n      * 90% of my network is in Japan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I took a 3-month break before starting to look for a job seriously. \n   * I won't go into details, but I was actually relieved to be on the chopping block and the 3-month break was absolutely necessary for my mental health albeit likely disastrous for my chances of being hired for a new job. RIP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have been speaking with a career consultant for 6 months and it has yielded no success.\n   * During our last conversation, she was at a complete loss and seemingly entirely out of ideas. She mentioned that I have tried everything in the book and she is shocked that I am still not getting any interviews. She even suggested looking into substitute teaching or even something like a school bus driver or local car wash until I can find something in my field. ... I wish this were a joke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My resume has been optimized for ATS systems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have been applying primarily for Communications Manager positions.\n   * My title was not manager at my previous company, but I took over the previous Communication Manager's job when he left to Japan (they didn't want to pay me Manager-level wages)\n      * I have experience managing vendors of up to 4 people, but no in-house management experience.\n   * I have also applied to some Senior Communications Specialist and lower level Marketing/Comms roles to no success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have sent out hundreds of applications and only earned 4 interviews.\n   * Two were HR screening interviews, two were with the people I would report to.\n      * Recently I had a 2nd interview with the VP of a company and I was ultimately unsuccessful.\n   * Most jobs I am applying for are local and tend to fetch between 50-200 applicants. I was shocked to see a recent listing have over 50 applicants within an hour of being re-posted...\n      * There haven't been any new postings for the past two weeks, but there have been plenty of re-posted jobs that I had already applied for and been either ghosted or rejected.\n   * I am focusing primarily on my state of residence. \n   * I have tried for out of state positions, but have been immediately rejected by their ATS systems every time (guessing location is the factor as I do not see these immediate rejections when applying locally).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have contacted agents specializing in Communications and have been either ghosted or rejected due to lack of experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have posted my resume on all of the major job boards to no success. \n   * Plenty of spam from people who are convinced I am perfect for the IT job they are seeking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I would like to continue my career in Communications and am ready to forgo my Japanese language abilities for my next job. It would be nice to finally get to experience working at a non-Japanese company for a change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat should pretty much sum up my situation. It usually takes me about 8-12 months to find a job, and they usually come when I least expect it. Be that as it may, I feel like I've tried everything and have entered a state of utter despair and hopelessness. I feel like my career is over. I am nearly 40 years old, single, and alone. While I do have some great friends around the world, none of them are nearby. I moved back to the US right before Covid hit, and I have never been the most outgoing person... \n\nSo, give it to me straight, Redditors! Is it curtains for me? Do I need to start again from scratch or should I keep trying in Comms? \n\nShould I continue focusing on Communications Manager job postings requesting experience of between 5-7 years (matching my experience level), or should I be focusing on lower-level positions that require less experience?\n\nHappy to relocate, but I'm always ATS rejected when I try for jobs that would require relocation. Even the ones that claim they support relocation!\n\nAlso, what the heck is going on in the job market right now? This does NOT feel normal to me. I have never seen this little success before in my job search, and this is not even close to my first rodeo. Does anyone have any ideas that can help me out?\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this post! Wishing you all the best of luck!!",

Wrenching out of that lowest rung took me over a year. While I sent 1000+ applications to basically any job that might hire me.  I had to take the minimum wage job as my savings ran out, literally everyone else ignored me. You probably will have to lower your standards, as mid and upper level people in FT positions are more likely to be holding onto their jobs with this uncertain economy (going into an election year to boot). I wish I could be more optimistic, but that possibility does exist.\n\nI would be tempted to say despite you don't want to deal with a Japanese company - at the very least you might have some better luck at US based subsidiaries of Japanese companies, or US companies that deal with that region frequently. If it's US owned or has a mission statement to maintain US values at that location, the work culture should be a little better (ie Sega vs Nintendo - the former more pleasurable than the other from friends I have in that industry - and yes I know there's more to that for Japanese companies, just pulled out the easiest example I could think of).\n\nIf you're still unemployed by July, perhaps explore taking the JLPT test to at least benchmark your knowledge - if you can get N2 or N1 it's better to get that out of the way for life. I'm not quite there yet as I've always been stuck stateside - stuck between N4 and N3 myself. Would have to travel outside the US to test as they only do December testing, but easy enough with a passport to pop north to a site in Canada (Vancouver/Edmonton/Toronto I believe).\n\nAlso change your career consultant - you likely need less of a consultant, and more of a high-level recruiter who is willing to put the work to land leads for you not just in your current state, but all over the US, and past ATS/computer based HR screening.  Clearly they're not able to help you anymore. You may have to aim for one in other cities, there's certain recruiting/temp agencies that have offices all over the US (ie at least in my field, that might be Creative Circle, not sure if they do more comm positions though....if you have Adobe and design skills, then there might be some marketing gigs there).\n\nNetworking at events/conventions in communications/your sector of previous experience may also help, since you're a bit new to being stateside again. Winter kinda sucks for that kind of thing in certain regions (ie where I live in the US, it usually slows WAYYY down during those months as travel becomes dangerous over mountain passes), but warm places like California usually have something.",

But I thought it was just the freshie feeling and tried shrugging it off. I tried really but now it's the weekend, the feeling is still there. Mainly because the job isn't how I expected it to be:\n\n\\- Work hours are 7AM - 5PM (Mon to Fri) and 7AM - 2PM (Sat), but they expect you to work at night too, unpaid and when you try to claim OT, they'd say well you can choose to not do it but if you choose to not do it from what I've seen of my colleagues, management would be sarcastic and throw shade during meetings.\n\n\\- I should've seen other red flags but I guess I was just desperate by then, they didn't want me to have my own copy of the employment contract. They insisted on having me sign face-to-face and I can't take a picture of it too.\n\n\\- What else? They actually want you to work on Sundays too and yes unpaid....\n\n\\- Oh and they promised commissions but apparently their commissions are fully depending on whether or not the boss favours you and not your actual performance (as told by some of my colleagues, that have been in the company for awhile now, they didn't leave because they got used to it)\n\n\\- Having to use Whatsapp mainly for work. In the job ad and during the interview, they never mentioned using Whatsapp for work. Now usually it'll be fine but having to look at 100+ patient groups daily and constantly having to check the phone for messages and reply to them, idk that caught me off guard.\n\nWhile the rest were able to get used to it, I am unsure if I should continue because whenever I'm done with work, I just feel mentally exhausted and constantly drained the moment I stepped into office or check my mails for notifications.\n\nI now have another job offer but at a lower pay but with better work life balance as I used to work in that exact position, I am tempted to take it but idk if it's actually ok to resign this early...\n\n**TLDR: Job has a bad work-life balance and when you complain, management yells at you. Job ad and interview said one thing and the actual job is another thing. Feeling burnt out every single day and even after work just thinking about work tires me. Is it ok to leave a week after joining?**\n\n**\\*\\*UPDATE: So after seeing these comments and of course with consultation with some friends and family too, I finally left the work. Honestly it was daunting, I handed the letter to the manager only for the manager to immediately call over her manager and they kept telling me it was unacceptable and that I require a month notice while they find a replacement for me. However, I told them I vividly remember the contract I signed  that they didn't want me to have a copy of, stated 1 week only. That clearly shut them up and I said my last week's work will be taken to offset the notice period. Obviously they kept calling but I just blocked them. So yea thanks guys :D**",

      "body": "So I'm 24 and work part time as a sales assistant in clothing. I'm a student and am finished at the end of the year so I'm working part time retail gigs for pocket money. It started as a Christmas gig around November, but I worked my absolute butt off and about a month after I started, I was offered a management position. All the management treated me golden, praised me during meetings and wanted me in their 'circle'. I was flattered, but ultimately turned it down because I knew it was full time but I was still studying full time so I couldn't do it. I still stayed as a casual, and continued to put 100% in, work really hard and continue to prove myself as hard working and capable.\n\nIn the meantime, I heard that many of my coworkers took badly to me being offered management, and many created a private group chat where they belited and made fun of me and thought I didn't deserve the job. One of my friends at work heard about this through someone who was in the chat. None of them knew that before I went back to college, I actually had 2.5 years of management experience from my last job or obviously how hard I worked. Still, I brushed it off as jealousy and they don't know me and just went there to do my job and nothing more. Then out of nowhere about 2 months ago, shit just hit the fan. I had several coworkers report me to my boss for the most miniscule things. One reported me for talking \"too long\" to a customer when I asked her about her weekend plans when I was putting the sale through. Another reported me for using scissors instead of a box cutter (I asked another manager for one and they said there were out). Another for taking my break only TEN minutes after my scheduled time because I was closing a sale worth THREE thousand dollars. The list went on. \n\nThen, my boss turned against me suddenly, obviously believing all these people, and then finding her own little things to pull me up for. Then last month, my work introduced store credit cards to try to scam customers into signing up for one. They always existed, but I was never told during my interview or when I first started that it was mandatory to sell them. It's not mentioned in my contract or job description either. But still, the pressure to sell them became unreasonably high. You can't just pressure people to get a fucking credit card, we're a clothing store not a bank! My manager screamed at me in front of 5 of my other coworkers on the sales floor for not getting a card yet. She said I was pulling everyone else down and that everyone's sick of picking up my slack. I could see my coworkers smirking with glee behind her. \n\n\nThen, to replace the management job I was offered, they picked two of my other coworkers to be team leaders instead.  Both of these people are a lot younger, have zero management experience and this is their first and and only job. Still, I gaveth the benefit of the doubt and I respected them as my superiors. Immediately, they both went on a massive power trip and directed all their pulling up activities at me and only me. I found out that one of the new managers is actually the person that STARTED the group chat about me. So knowing that I had a manager who had a preexisting unjustified hatred towards me made me feel very unsafe and sick to go to work. Two weeks ago, I rock up to my shift and one of my team leaders asked to have a \"chat\" to me. I knew it was serious, and expected to go into a meeting room of some sort for privacy. No. She takes me to the stockroom where in eye and ear view of 10 other employees, begins to tell me that in July there are performance reviews and I'm one of the half a dozen or so who are looking at not keeping their jobs. She never explicitly said \"you'll be fired\"  but she told me that I'm a \"grey area\" and \"sell a card or you won't be moving on with us\". I was shaken and told her I didn't understand. I told her I go above and beyond my sales targets, get nothing but praise from customers and other managers up until now. She told me \"don't talk back to me just do your job\" so I told her I'm really trying and will continue to. Instead of giving me the chance to be on the sales floor to actually sell one, I'm forced to spend my whole shift unpacking stock in the back. I realised then and there that my time was fast approaching an end there, and I should start applying for  other jobs.\n\nThen they cut my shifts, and I didn't get one for almost two weeks. Then Thursday I had my first shift in that time, but still I kept positive and happy and went to work in a good mood and told myself I'd work hard and get a card. Not even five minutes into my shift, BOTH of the team leaders come up to me and both ask to see me privately. Again I'm thinking okay I'm either gonna be fired now or I'll be yelled at again. They take me again into the back room. Zero privacy or dignity and both of them gang up against me 2-1 with the same horse shit. I later found out via my country's union that having two managers against one person is not okay in HR standards but whatever. So they both begin with the same story. That I still haven't sold a card, that I'm dragging everyone else down and so on. I said to them I haven't been here for two weeks to get the chance to sell one. Then they both put on 'sweetheart' voices and say in a really bitchy way \"Well that's why you're here today...to get one\". Then the threats started. \"So you're still not looking good for the people that will be cut after June\", \"Our manager is currently interviewing for new staff\", and \"There's letters are currently being sent out to the people that won't be moving with us\". They didn't explicitly say \"and you're on the list\" but you get the jist. I told them again that I'm trying really really hard and selling a credit card isn't as easy as signing up to a mailing list but I will try.\n\n\nI felt really bullied and defeated that they both went two against one publicly where lots of other staff saw. I still tried to hold my dignity and went back on to the floor with smiles even though I wanted to cry and throw up inside. I did really good with sales. Then..every twenty minutes yes twenty one of the team leaders would come up to me and only me to ask if I've gotten a card yet. When they both went on their breaks I used the opportunity to ask the seven other people on my team that night if out of curiosity they've gotten a card since they started pushing them. All but one said *nope*, I asked if they've had it mentioned it to them. Only *one* did and she said it was briefly mentioned at the start of their shift to get one if she could. That was my breaking point. I went on my break after that and bawled my eyes out in the bathroom cause I realised it was only me they were targeting and unfairly at that. So I come back and keep trying to get a card to no avail. Then about an hour before closing it was obviously dead quiet and I accepted that I'll be lucky if I serve one person so how the hell am I gonna get a card. Then one of my team leaders came up to me and instructed me to stand in another section where it might get busier to sell a card. I happily obliged with a continued smile on my face. Not a single person came in to that section, but I did what I was told and stood there anyway. I realised about fifteen minutes before closing that I still need to tidy up my department's section and went back over to do it. I raced around the racks finger spacing it and making it look pretty when my team leader came up to me. \n\nShe put on a \"sweetheart\" voice but I could hear the bitchy undertones. She asked me how I found my shift today. I told her that while I'm naturally disappointed I didn't sign up a card, I did very well with sales. She smacked her lips and said \"right...it's just that I just couldn't help but notice now that you're looking incredibly sad and mopey and it's not a good look\". I actually laughed and said to her \"sorry? I've been nothing but smiles the whole day, I've been expressionless yes while I'm tidying up the racks but why would I be smiling at the racks I'm tidying up?\" She pursed her lips and goes \"right well it's just not a good look and something to take on board\". I said to her okay I will..? But it doesn't stop there. She then continued to say \"I also can't help but notice that you're tidying the racks up now but it's something that should've been done an hour ago\". I told her that I would've, but you specifically asked me to spend the last hour in another section to try and get a card, which I **did** so how could I do both at once? She pursed her lips again and just said \"anyway thanks for the day we're closed now so you can go home\". So I'm certain that she'll spin this and tell our boss that I'm sad and mopey, that I don't tidy up, whatever she can spin to make me look bad.\n\n\nI left and cried walking to the train station. I cried on the train and then when I got home I basically had a big fat breakdown to my parents and brother. They were all gob smacked and told me that this is bullying and threatening and should quit. Now. I have a tonne of savings from working during Christmas and I still live at home and study full time anyway so it's fine for me to be suddenly unemployed I know I can find another part time retail job soon. But I don't know how to quit. I would like to mention that I also get really bad anxiety. It was under control for a while, but this last two weeks I've hyperventilated and had panic attacks on the daily. It should be easy for me to just call my boss and tell her I'm done except for me it's kind of not. My brain just can't do it. So then my friend said well fuck it if they don't give a shit about you, don't give a shit about them email your boss and just do it like that. I don't know what else to do. I know that going in to quit will lead to me breaking down, crying or letting it all out and I just can't mentally handle it anxiety wise. My next shift isn't until this coming thursday, and it's for three hours (I was getting 3x7 hour shifts a week) only so as you can see, I'm being cut out already. So if I was to email my boss today, she'd surely see it by Monday. My brother works in a building a block over and offered to go in and give my badge and staff card back if they request it. I know two people who quit by email with little to no notice, and neither of them even got a reply back from my boss. I only know one person who quit in advance with two weeks notice, and she was forced to fill out some resignation form. Surely they can't make me do the same? I'm a casual. I don't really care about \"bridges being burned\" because my reference is from my previous assistant manager who left during my \"peak\" there and we're FB friends and all that and always told me I'm welcome to use her as a reference. \n\n\nBut I don't know what else to do, I mentally cannot deal. I've slept 3-4 hours every night the last two weeks, barely eat either, have panic attacks and cry everyday. Please help me.\n\nEdit: far out I can’t believe one of y’all gave me gold. My first ever reddit gold. Thank you so much, truly from the bottom of my heart to you and everyone else who left me a comment and message. Thank you so so much.

      "body": "TL:DR at bottom\n\nHi sub, first post here. I've been searching for a new job in my field in a different part of the country from where I live, my family has been wanting to move back bear where we grew up. So after 5 months of applying and being ghosted after the first round of phone interviews I finally got two requests for me to fly out to meet both companies for in person interviews.\n\nI took off work and flew out to meet them, set one up for Wednesday morning and the other for the afternoon. The morning interview at company A went ok but I was not that excited for the job, they told me they had two more interviews and would let me know.\n\nAfter lunch I drove across town to company B and their world headquarters. After having a 3 hour marathon of meetings with HR, the VP of Operations and the person who would be my department head. By the time we finished up it was EOB but we both thought it would be a good fit an they invited me to come in and shadow the team I would be in charge of the next day.\n\nI arrived at 10 am Thursday and spent time with the team, even had a few of them already calling me boss man. Right before lunch time the department head came down to check in and said that I could stay if I want but they were putting  together an offer for me that would meet everything I was asking for including a bonus to relocate! and that I could come by on Friday to make it all official, but didn't give me many details.\n\nAfter lunch I called company A to tell them to take me off the list and called the wife to tell her the good news and to start working on getting a transfer at her job. \n\nMy flight was scheduled to leave at 1 pm, so I arrived at 8 am presumably to meet with HR and sign an offer sheet. I checked in with security and told them I had a meeting with Mrs. HR. He said she was not in today I would have to reschedule. I asked him then to see if Mr. Dept head was available, the guard picked up the called him up and after telling him I was here said \"I'll let him know\". Then tell me \"Sir your not allowed on the premises I'm going to have to ask you to leave\". \n\nExcuse me what?\n\nI leave to go to my car and tried calling HR and DH but both were not answering, and after a few minutes of searching I found the number for the VP in the bottom of my interview email chain, so I blocked my number and called him on his extension. Barely did I get out \"Hi this is u/greatlarrybird33\" before she hung up on me.\n\nWhat the hell, there is nothing in my background that could have popped up, hell I haven't even gotten a ticket in 15 years. I don't know anyone at the company other than my contacts. \n\nI can live with ghosting me after a phone call, but after I've spent $1200 on airfare and a hotel plus 3 days of personal time used. What the hell man, I don't get companies. Think they will pay up if I send them a bill?\n\nTldr got ghosted by a company after flying out having an in person interview and basically having a job offer.",

They'll probably ask about times you've improved process efficiency, handled data inconsistencies, or worked with technical teams to implement solutions.\n\nThe key is connecting your fulfillment experience to financial operations - both involve moving things through systems, ensuring accuracy, managing exceptions, and coordinating between multiple stakeholders. Prepare examples of how you've streamlined processes, dealt with data quality issues, or collaborated with engineering teams on system improvements. They'll want to see that you can think like a product manager who understands both the business impact and technical feasibility of solutions.

They’ll likely focus on how you identify automation opportunities and handle trade-offs between finance and engineering needs. Brush up on stakeholder mgmt too because balancing these teams is key. Run through mock interviews with a focus on mapping out problems and product solutions around financial workflows.

I handle posting the job, screening candidates, and coordinating the onboarding.

Communication was spotty from the start, but eventually she signed and I prepared everything for her first day. The day before she was supposed to start, she told me she couldn’t because of a family emergency. I respected that, gave her two weeks to resolve it, and set up a new start date. But again, communication was difficult, and on the morning of her second start date, she called to say the family emergency still wasn’t resolved. At that point, I started to think maybe there was never an emergency at all.\n\nCandidate #2:\nI reposted the job, interviewed more people, and finally found someone I was really excited about. We stayed in touch all week, and I asked her to come in the day before her start date to do paperwork. When the day came… nothing. No-show. I texted, I called—no response. It even seems like I was blocked.\n\nI’m honestly baffled at the level of unprofessionalism. A simple “I got another offer, I’m no longer interested” would have been fine.

I worked as a manager in corporate world up until 2 1/2 years ago.  At that point I partially retired.  I have been working part time security and living off investments.  These combine to replicate my previous salary.  I could very easily do this for the next 10 years until I fully retire.  Or I could go back to full time work in the right position and retire in 6 years.  That is why I am looking.  But there is no desperation and choosing the right position is important to me.

      "body": "I genuinely loved my accounting lectures in college. And as the first person in my family to graduate from university, I felt like I was on top of the world. But the working world is a whole different story. I swear I've done everything I can. I've tried everything: time-blocking, the Eisenhower matrix, daily planners, a sea of sticky notes on my monitor, and even carried a small notebook in my pocket at all times. But it's never been enough. I try my best to stick to the plan and stay focused, but there's always a small detail that slips through the cracks.\n\nI can get completely lost in a complex reconciliation for another project, and suddenly realize hours have passed and I've missed a deadline for something else. There are days when my brain just freezes when I know I have to start something important, so I procrastinate. The idea of juggling all the work from different managers feels impossible. And the social aspect is a nightmare. I go to team lunches and company events, but I'm incredibly awkward. I try to be friendly, but I can never connect with my coworkers. I'm trapped inside my own head, overthinking everything. And it gets much worse when I have to explain something complex out loud. Writing it in an email is no problem at all, but there's like a disconnect between my thoughts and my speech. Honestly, I'm at my lowest point.\n\nMy horrible internship at a Big 4 firm completely destroyed me. I thought that going to a supposedly chill corporate job would be the solution, but here I am failing all over again. Seriously, thank you to anyone who took the time to read all this rambling. Anyway, enough feeling sorry for myself. With a degree in accounting, what else is out there for someone like me? I'm starting to feel like the corporate ladder thing isn't for me. Are there any non-traditional paths I should be looking into?\n\nEdit: Thank you for bringing the symptoms of the illness to my attention. I will consult a doctor as soon as possible.\n\nI hope this helps and that they prescribe me medication so I can start to get better. I feel like I can't live my normal life.\n\nAlso, the idea of being the first person in my family \\[to experience this\\] has put me under a lot of pressure and an uncomfortable responsibility. I will try to talk to them about this.\n\nThank you for your advice.

Your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to be kind to yourself in this moment.\n\nHere are 3 supportive, practical steps to help with job interview anxiety\n\n* Start small and practice in a safe space- Before another real interview, rehearse answers to common questions out loud. Tools like Nora AI can help by letting you practice and rehearse in a low-pressure environment, so you get used to speaking without the fear of judgment. This can gradually reduce anxiety and build confidence.\n* Focus on grounding techniques during interviews- Simple strategies like taking slow, deep breaths before answering, pausing for a moment to collect your thoughts, and even having short notes in front of you can calm your nervous system. It’s okay to pause or repeat a question if you need a second  interviewers expect it.\n* Shift the mindset from “performing perfectly” to sharing your story- Instead of aiming to give a flawless answer, aim to communicate clearly and authentically. Remind yourself: they want to see you, your thought process, and your potential not perfection. Celebrate the small wins in every practice round and interview.\n\nYou’re carrying a lot right now, but you’ve already accomplished so much academically and professionally. One interview doesn’t erase your achievements and your next opportunity will be a place that sees your value. Take gentle steps, practice safely with tools like Nora AI and allow yourself patience as you rebuild confidence. You’re capable and this moment does not define your path ❤️",

      "body": "*Context: EE with 5YoE. I like writing. This is meant to sound tongue in cheek*\n\nWelcome to the social experiment that is electrical engineering (EE) interviews, where a (probably balding 50 year old) man asks you to “design a filter real quick,” just to watch you crater like you’re about to land a plane. For once, you *actually* know how to draw the dang thing with the op amp… and yet you still lose points. \n\nWhen I’m interviewing EE candidates, here are a few things I’m honing on.\n\n**Silence is golden**\n\nI’m going to go walk back my take on the “talk nonstop” advice. There’s more nuance. I’ve seen that nearly 75% of the candidates in fact end up falling into the “talk nonstop nonsense” or “completely flatline” camp.\n\nYes, you must be communicative. However being intentional regarding your thought process/planning are critical. Let’s look at a few mental frameworks next.\n\n**Ready…Aim…Fire**\n\nPeople always say “*oh, take a bird’s eye view*”. Other than a LinkedIn catch phrase, it’s also a good interview strategy.  \n\nI highly recommend that candidates ask clarifying details before jumping in. Too many questions regarding numbers and figures are asked rather than gathering planning state info on scenarios, priorities, edge cases, or functionality. For example, I personally know a candidate has the correct thought process when he asks, *“Is the priority noise floor or power?”* or *“Do you care more about transient response or efficiency?”*\n\n**Please make it easy on us**\n\nMore cliché advice. Interviewers *are* human. I have a meeting in an hour and a deadline next week. Therefore, the mind palace that you’re guiding us through is going to need a few ‘turn here’ signs.\n\nHere’s another framework I really like. I’ll call it the “heading framework”. Nearly every single engineering problem in real life has at least some of the following -&gt; assumptions, plans, checks, and risks. Let’s make these the 4 main categories of our framework. Now narrate through this framework. \n\n* *“I’ll assume room temp and nominal components first”*\n* *“My plan is to sketch the block diagram”*\n* *“If I had a scope I’d measure setup and hold times”*\n* *“The risk here is stability”.* \n\nI don’t expect you to get full proficiency with these frameworks, but practice does make perfect. I see Reddit threads asking for interview topics all the time. And while there’s a lot of great EE interview resources, topics, and problems on *Hacker Rank, Voltage Learning, or YouTube*, don’t be afraid to look at the job description and make up your own problems. It’s a true cheat sheet to interview topics.\n\nAnd most of all, help me truly understand you. I want to know how you are to work with, how you conduct yourself, and most of all, can I stand spending 8 hours a day in a hot and windowless lab with you. ",

      "body": "Hi all! Presently, I have been preparing for behavioral interviews roughly using the STAR method, but also by memorizing some things to say (since I'm not very eloquent off the cuff) in advance for certain categories...\n\nHowever, **I'm finding these responses to be very unnatural and a bit rambly in person**. Does anyone have any advice on how to fix this? Or how best to prepare?\n\n\\----\n\nExample: Collaboration &amp; Teamwork\n\nAt \\[company XXX\\], we received critical client feedback that our product was frankly, confusing and visually unappealing. This was a major concern since user experience directly impacts client retention and, therefore, our company's growth. So, we decided to revamp everything. I was tasked with leading the technical side while our designer handled the mockups—but we hit a problem immediately: our designer kept getting pulled onto higher-priority client work, leaving me with incomplete wireframes and multiple stakeholders needing approval for every decision.\n\nRather than wait for perfect conditions, I established a direct communication process with the designer. Whenever I needed to extrapolate from incomplete mockups, I'd message her with specific questions: \"Your design shows this pattern here—I'm planning to build this page, this and this page, doing something like X using your approach here. Does that work?\" When I wasn't confident in my ideas, I'd just say it: \"I think my idea is terrible. Do you have another idea?\" That honesty saved us both time and kept momentum.\n\nFor bigger design decisions, I'd take screenshots and videos of my proposed implementations to make them concrete and easy to review. I posted these in our public project channel so management could see what I was building beyond the original wireframes, and I waited for approval before proceeding but simultaneously kept busy by working on the next piece of the project, to make sure it wasn’t blocked. I also organized cross-company meetings to align everyone before each deployment phase—no surprises, no costly rework.\n\nThe result was a complete redesign that transformed our confusing interface into something clean and responsive. The designer told me later she appreciated the directness and how I made her review process efficient. Management stayed satisfied throughout because the transparent communication framework kept everyone informed and aligned. Most importantly, we created a sustainable collaboration system that became a template for future design work at\n\n\\----\n\nTl;dr - Using STAR, also memorizing specific answers, but **I'm finding these responses to be very unnatural and a bit rambly in person**.

      "body": "I used to think I was bad at interviews until I sat on the other side of the table. Since then, I’ve watched a lot of electrical engineers (EE) walk into interviews like it’s a pop quiz plus coupled with interpretive dance. They sit down, fumble through the resume walk, calculate voltage dividers incorrectly, and proceed to spend 15 minutes remembering what an XOR gate is.\n\nI personally don’t think interviewing is fully reinventing the wheel. Here are tactics that make you look like a real EE, even when your brain does the Windows shutdown sound. \n\n**Circuit design: don’t be an artist**\n\nWhen I ask “design an amplifier / filter / regulator,” don’t start sketching like you’re doing your best Michelangelo interpretation. This is what I’m looking for, start with three questions (example): What are the input and output ranges? What is the load? What is the noise, bandwidth, or ripple target?\n\nMoral of the story: Asking questions before shows that you adapt to real world considerations. It shows thought processes and what you would do when a situation like this presents itself.\n\n**Block diagramming: KISS philosophy**\n\nI should’ve written this point before the previous because circuit diagrams are overrated. A lot of EEs lose points because they jump straight into details. You know who doesn’t jump into deep end, actual engineers when they design systems. Draw a clean block diagram first, even if they asked for a circuit. Start with source, conditioning, conversion, processing, output. Label domains: analog, digital, power. Keep it simple guys, no need to start doing logic reduction immediately.\n\n**Communication: Intentionally overdo it**\n\nTalk… that’s it. Say everything, think everything, and then say it again. Bonus points for using a consistent structure. It keeps you from rambling and it makes the interviewer’s notes easy. Silence doesn’t mean that you’re thinking hard, it means that your eyes have glazed over.\n\n**Interview topics: Does anyone read the JD?**\n\nThis is by far the most mind-boggling thing. If it’s an analog role, there’s going to be circuit design. If it’s an ASIC design role, there will likely be RTL, logic design, floorplanning. Read the JD and you get literally everything that they’re asking for. **In fact it so easy that I have my very own EE technical interview resource with topics and exercises linked within my profile**. No road map necessary (or allowed). In fact, I’ll be willing to bet that interview topics haven’t drastically changed in like 5 years, since we’re all technically doing the same nonsense.\n\nOk finally real talk… interviewers are human. Sometimes tired, sometimes under pressure, sometimes with tight deadlines. Yet, it’s nonnegotiable to make yourself seem like a likable human being who is good to run around with for 8+ hours every day in a windowless office. ",

It was a Teams interview and the manager and coordinator of the campaign were there, same as one of the supervisors of the campaign there, bummer it wasn't one of the two I talked with about the interview in the past weeks for advice. \n\nSo far each of them only made me two questions, the manager did the \"why should we hire YOU?\" and my biggest strengths and weaknesses, To which I listed that I've been aiming for that position since I entered, I listed several accomplishments, my almost spotless record of adherence, dedication to my work, some stories about how I helped my co-workers and helped solve specific situations, as well as being a trusted employee from my own supervisor who has extra confidential tasks, and my weaknesses of being a little too reliant on protocols and formal things to the point I come off as robotic and non-empathetic and sometimes I end up blocking situations that are actually flexible for customers, this is where I feel like I could've said something better since I worry that if they perceive me as lacking communicative skills, I am immediately disqualified. \n\nThe supervisor in the interview put those two situations I've been told, the scenario of a top performer whose metrics are now dropping, I used the one I practiced with my supervisor of first approaching him, ask him if there is something going on that caused the sudden change, and listed different approaches depending on what the agent would say. Same with a chronically late agent (apparently they do that to every single one who applies for any supervisor position), so I aced that one with the protocol I was taught, though half the actual corporate words that I thought would impress them for this specific scenario I role played over and over I forgot them :'''(\n\nGood thing is, they didn't put me in an active roleplay of the scenario, I PHEWED internally at that. \n\nNext, the coordinator of the campaign asked \"What is being a supervisor to you?\" And my availability, And this is where I think I fumbled because I got nervous and said more generic stuff like \"the biggest thing of being in a leadership position is listening, to create the best results for the company\" over and over and started stumbling with the words and had several pauses that made me look like I was unprepared, they told from tomorrow to three days they would tell me if I was chosen, and if so, I would start next week, but honestly I feel so dumb for ratting myself out with those answers.

Maintain a sleep schedule and get adequate rest.  Everything becomes more difficult and more dramatic if you are not getting enough sleep.\n\n2. Exercise. You don’t have to train for a marathon,  it could be walking the dog around the block, stretching everyday, doing chair yoga, or even actually training for a marathon. In other words, just do some sort of intentional movement. \n\n3. Take up or continue a hobby. Yes, some hobbies can be spending, but there are a lot of things you can do that don’t have a high price tag. \n\nHave you wanted to draw but think you have zero talent? The folks you see that make those fabulous drawings didn’t start out drawing like that! Pick up a spiral bound drawing pad, some drawing pencils and a good eraser. You can easily find a lot of that at a thrift store. At Walmart it would be around $20, or even Dollar Tree has stuff.  Dollar Tree has some decent fine line pens.  Then set aside 15-30 minutes twice a day. There are a ton of tutorials on You Tube.  You could even learn to Zentangle, which is essentially fancy doodling, lettering and more. \n\nThe reason I say spiral notebook is because then you can look back and actually see your progress.\n\n4. Volunteer. If you have a special skill in your career, volunteer somewhere you can use that skill. It doesn’t need to be for a huge amount of hours, but it still shows you are active and relevant to your career. Bonus, it could bring in job leads and add to your networking. \n\nSo take care of yourself, it will show in your interview. And remember, interviewing is one persons opinion on your skills that given day. You can interview with ten people in a day and get 10 completely opinions on your employability.\n\nI’ve been in your shoes, after taking an intentional break from work after I was laid off.

I took that as a good sign and stayed committed to the process.\n\nThen today, the day before the final interview, I suddenly got an email saying they cannot proceed because I am not located in one of their approved hiring states. This was never mentioned in the job description or in any of the earlier interviews.\n\nIt felt like they kept me hanging for over a month only to drop this on me at the last minute. I had already prepared for the final round and blocked time specifically for it.\n\nI replied saying I am open to relocating to any of their approved states, and I also mentioned that I have already applied for another role on their team. I honestly don’t know if they will reconsider now.\n\nHas anyone gone through something like this? Does relocation usually help, or is this the type of policy companies do not move on?\n\nJust needed to share because the timing and the whole experience felt really unfair.",

      "title": "I had a job interview last week but the position is already being advertised again",
      "body": "I've been unemployed for 5 months now and have been applying for multiple jobs with no success. The frustration and rejection is getting to me and pretty soon I'm going to run out of the severence pay. I just want to know how people here survive for months unemployed looking for a job. Both financially and mentally.  Feeling so despondent and stressed out and I started using sleeping tablets recently and just want to get people's advice on how to cope and also advice about a specific job I applied for \n\nI had like 6 or 7 interviews in the past few months which I either didn't get the post for or I'm still awaiting feedback. I think I suck at interviews. Like I know what I should say or what the correct answer should be but I don't communicate my answers eloquently and stumble on the answers especially if they're technical questions (I'm the opposite when it comes to written conversation). I also get a mental block when they ask  questions I normally know answers for. I  noticed that after the interviews everything seems okay and they indicate that they will be contacting references (there's no negative events in my past work experiences but I did make a comment to HR at my previous company after I was retrenched about areas my line manager was lacking and improvements the manager could make - don't know if that got back to her). I usually give a list of references of people who will vouch for me positively but they then ask for a reference specifically for my line manager, which I'm then forced to give. Not sure if she has been mentioning anything negative. \n\nComing to my last interview I did a week ago. It went just okay. I wouldn't say great as I didn't answer some questions adequately.  This week the HR calls for me to give them my current health insurance amount and references they can contact. A day later I saw on their website that the job  was advertised again. Should I assume I didn't get the job? They also interviewed multiple other people. \n \nI saw a post for another unit for a similar post (different unit but probably the same HR department both units). I ended up applying for the other post. Do you think applying before I get feedback on the interview would affect either posts. I just sent the email application and wondering if I should retract it\n\nSorry for the long rant",
