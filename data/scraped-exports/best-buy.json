      "body": "I recently got accepted into SDE Amazon but did not get an offer yet, the recruiter reached out to me saying “excellent impression…strong performance…actively working in identifying the best team…expect to heart back in a week or two”. \n\nI have 2 years of experience, currently a SDE-2 at a fintech making around $117k (no bonus, stocks etc) - exceptional work life balance, WFH and on track to become a team lead in another 1.5 years. I have been looking for the hustle culture and in-person work though. \n\nAmazon will be a significant pay bump (I think - I’m comparing just the base because I’m not planning on staying there till my RSUs vest but ik it’s also bad mentality starting a new job thinking that) but there’s so many negative things I’ve heard about it that I don’t know if it’s the right move. Plus I have no idea about the location or compensation yet (or idk what if they withdraw the offer altogether). \n\nBut the problem why I’m freaking out is I need to move this Saturday (I’m planning on buying new furniture cause I was renting etc etc). I don’t know if I should just hold off on moving (cause moving is a hassle and I don’t want to have to buy and sell mediated sell furniture etc). \n\nWhat can I do? Is it worth lying to the recruiter that I have other offers (I am in other interview processes though). I know I’m definitely overthinking this. ",

      "body": "Been at my current job five years, started out as a software engineer but for the last two years I've stepped into the engineering manager role and taken on countless new responsibilities; hiring staff, mentoring/on-boarding new hires, 1 on 1 meetings, scrum master responsibilities for two scrum teams, aws infrastructure oversight and backup, fighting emergencies/urgent fires, doing code reviews, etc. I genuinely enjoy these responsibilities/challenges, I've learned so much, but it has me always feeling like there is never enough time in the day and to top it off, the CEO seems to think I should be completing coding tasks as an individual contributor on top of everything else. This is really starting to stress me out and it is taking its toll on me. I've asked for a raise recently and was denied because \"I ask too much\" but was told I would get a raise later this year up to 100k(Context: I got a raise one year ago,  so it has been a year success my last request). There were no dates committed to that 100k raise just a verbal commitment... Current salary 96k in Phoenix AZ. Is this normal or am I being taken advantage of? I've got a couple interviews lined up but I'm struggling with being able to make the time to study and job hunt with my current job's responsibilities/stress. I've got 6+ months expenses saved up already so I'm thinking it might be in my mental health's best interest to put in my notice soon and focus on studying/interviewing. What does Reddit think?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the replies so far, I'm going to start going through and replying to them at lunch and after work!\n\nEdit 2: \nSorry it took so long, this blew up more than I anticipated, so many replies! Thank you all for the info and advice, it has been enlightening! I'll touch on some of the main points/questions I'm seeing in the comments. \n\n1. My fears seem to be true, I am being taken advantage of. I was thinking this was the case but needed some honest opinions on this to be sure.\n2. Why am I a Scrum Master and an engineering manager? This is a great question and I agree, this is absolutely a conflict of interest. Unfortunately, I've brought this up with the CEO and COO and they just laughed it off which honestly felt like a red flag to me at the time but what can you do it is the CEO? To combat this, I try to be extremely mindful of how I communicate and act during meetings to make sure that the team knows that they can say anything they need to say without it coming back to hurt them later. Right after I first started at the company, we had a product owner who was a scrum master and let me tell you, that was a nightmare. After a lot of explaining and data gathering, I was able to fix that problem but it wasn't easy. More often than not, I feel like the only higher-up person who gives a damn about the principles of Scrum and why they are important to follow.\n3. Why am I still at the company? Another good question that I find I am asking myself more and more. Two years ago it was, \"Oh wow this company wants to make me a manager already? That is going to be a great opportunity to learn an entirely new side of the software industry and will be great for the resume\". Two years later and now I have some experience so there isn't much keeping me here (Granted I love my team but that doesn't buy nice things).\n4. What size is the company? It is a smaller company, 25 employees so resources are often limited for certain things.\n5. Are you delegating? I delegate a good deal of work but I agree with the comments I am seeing on here, I should delegate even more things and that would have to help out a bit.\n6. Have you showed CEO your schedule? I've gotten pretty detailed verbally but never actually wrote out a list and showed him.\n\n\nI'm going to try to keep gutting it out as long as I can to land another job but if I hit the breaking point, which I feel I am approaching, I'll put in my notice without hesitation. I'm going to focus as much of my free time as possible to interview/study and land that next job.",

Right now I am on the hiring team of one of the \"bigger\" tech companies (and have been on a few of some smaller) (please do not ask for a job), and have been seeing a ton of resumes across the board and would love to share my findings:\n\n* Please please please stick to one page. After having days of reviewing 100+ resumes, it is really hard to sift through resumes that are 3+ pages. I can guarantee you that most of us are either not reading those resumes at all or are zoning out.\n* Tailor your resume to the job. There are too many times where I have to read that you have been a cashier at Best Buy for a software dev position. Some may say that putting some experience is better than none at all, but it would be a lot better to just load up with projects instead of work experience if you do not have any.\n* You CAN get a job at one of the big companies without a referral, but if you network (and I mean with higher up seniors and hiring managers, not lvl 1-3 devs) they can really help get your name on the board and at least get you an interview.\n* It is okay to put school projects on your resume, but make sure you mention core skills utilized/learned.\n* We do not want to see robots. Yeah, its cool that you know 1000+ libraries and languages, but we also want to see that you are a general team player and are capable of learning. It is okay to be new at something or even not know something at all. We expect you to learn on the job.\n* It is very obvious when you use AI to write your resumes/help out on a second screen during interviews. You are not slick.\n* It is okay to be a little nervous during the interview.\n* Most of the time, the interviewers have no idea what they are really interviewing for. Most of the time the hiring manager will just ask the team for help interviewing specific topics. They are not out to get you. Just try to give off a good energy and try to show that you have some idea of what you are doing, most of the time it should be good enough.\n* Everyone's experiences are different. Interviewing with one team from a certain company may be completely different with another team.\n\nThat is all I have for now. Will attempt to update more if my brain isn't fried by the end of the workday. Please do not ask me to review your resume.\n\nMods: please take this down if it breaks any rules. I've just been reading resumes all day and thought I could lend in a different viewpoint.",

Yes, that's all it took for them to have a panic attack and fire everyone.\n\nSince then, everyone left had their 401k match cut, got their raises frozen, and had to do the work of 2 or more people. The company culture got fucking toxic.

      "body": "    Hey guys, I wanted to share my story with the community for inspiration and encouragement. I simplified it as much as possible but it's still pretty long. I hope you enjoy and get something out of it. Happy to answer questions.\n\nI grew up middle to upper-middle class in a small town in the US. There were some issues in my family— divorce, mental illness, etc, but they are good people and I don’t blame them for anything that happened. In school I was “gifted” and got good test scores but never was a great student. I struggled to pay attention and always preferred messing around with my friends and playing video games to studying. I loved computers and technology but never really had a direction. This lack of work ethic would come back to bite me later on. I did the absolute minimum to apply for colleges but ended up getting into a state university because my teachers and parents pushed me (thanks guys).\n\nAround this time I started smoking weed and I loved it. It coincided with me moving away from home, so I could get away with smoking all the time. It was just weed in college after all. Harmless, right? Soon I was smoking multiple times a day and partying on the weekends, not taking school seriously at all. I didn’t even declare a major. I started dabbling in other stuff— Adderall to study, ecstasy and acid at an EDM show, Xanax or Vicodin to chill out. People would express concern about my behavior but I was in denial. My life started falling apart. I flunked out of school. I was always high, always broke, relationships falling apart from my shitty behavior, working shitty jobs to buy drugs first and then pay rent if there was money left over. At some point I got introduced to heroin and that was the beginning of the end.\n\nI descended really quickly into full-blown addiction. I completely destroyed my life, did terrible things to people I cared about. I got a really nasty spine injury while intoxicated and still have the side effects. At one point I almost died from an overdose. I only survived because someone found me in the bathroom. I woke up in an ambulance. I was totally broken as a person, facing homelessness, living off food stamps. It was by far the worst time of my life and I won’t say any more about it.\n\nEventually I asked for help and spent a year bouncing in and out of treatment, community support groups, etc and eventually managed to get sober. Happy to go more in depth on how I did it but it was a lot of work as well as help from other people in my life.\n\nI reached out to the school I flunked out of and ended up talking to a dean. I told him my story and he helped me get back in. I was broke but loans, grants, and cheap in-state tuition came through for me. At one point I had three part-time jobs in addition to my classes. I picked engineering since I could get a 4-year degree and start making money right away, but switched to computer science because it was fun and I couldn’t get into the engineering program due to my shit GPA. I am very, very glad I switched to CS.\n\nIt was hard trying to stay sober and go to school and work and learn how to program in my mid-20s. At one point I slipped up and relapsed, but I again reached out to the people around me for help and got back on track. I was fat and lonely and wanted to date, so I started working on my fitness, learning to dress better, putting myself out there on dating apps— these are other things I’m very glad I did. All this shit sucked and I was unhappy but I kept going. It’s not like I had a better option. My classes were hard but I kept trying and gradually built up my work ethic. Through persistent effort I started to do well in school for the first time. I was making friends, I lost weight and found some sports I really enjoyed, and I was even going on dates.\n\nEventually I went to a career fair and found out you were supposed to get an internship. What? I applied for a few and got demolished in the single interview I had. I took classes over the summer instead. The next year I went to the career fair and went to literally every table. I failed the interviews cause I still didn’t know what I was doing but I followed up via email on my prospects and found a program where someone had dropped out and they needed a replacement. Nice! This was my big break. They hired me with almost no interview.\n\nI was absolutely terrible in my internship, working with kids way younger than me who somehow were way smarter than me, but I kept showing up. I built relationships with my coworkers and they let me work part-time during the school year and full-time in the summer my last two years of school. Not because I was some bright shining talent but because I showed up reliably and was pleasant to be around. I was never any good but I learned a lot and earned enough money to stop taking out loans (huge win).\n\nThe fall before my graduation I knew a lot more about the job market and what interviews were like. I got a book on coding interview prep and practiced as much as I could. I went to every job fair and found every new grad hiring program I could online. I applied and got a ton of rejections— but also a ton of interviews. I ended up graduating with 8 job offers. Most of them were for smaller companies in my state but one of them was at a big coastal tech company with comp in the mid six figures. I seriously could not believe it and accepted.\n\nLife has been fantastic since then. I’m over five years sober from drugs and booze and engaged to be married to a great person (and a doctor!) I have a job I enjoy that can be challenging and stressful but is ultimately very rewarding. I work on cool technology with people I respect and learn from. I like where I am but I keep my skills sharp in case the time comes for me to move to a different company. I never would have thought I would have this lifestyle or earn this kind of money— more than any of my friends or family and I’m still very early in my career. One thing I absolutely cannot forget is that every day is a choice to keep working and doing what I need to do to keep my life on track. It would be so easy to fuck it up and go back to where I was.\n\nLessons learned:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Fix your problems. If you have something wrong in your life, mental illness, toxic relationship, addiction, family issues, whatever, get it under control however you can. Sometimes that means separating yourself from people that are messing your life up. Once your life is in order, everything else will fall into place.\n2. Do whatever it takes. I had to desperately seek recovery to get and stay sober. It had to be my top priority and I barely made it. But I did it. When I applied this to other parts of my life such as fitness and my career, those took off as well. Learn computer science fundamentals (data structures and algorithms). Practice coding problems— they will make you smarter and the best jobs will test your knowledge in interviews. I’ve seen people on this sub make all kinds of excuses why they don’t do this, but let’s be honest, it’s just laziness. You can do it. Keep working at it until you get where you want to be. We have it easier than pretty much any other profession.\n3. Be a three-dimensional person. Take care of your body— it’s meant to move and not to sit in front of a screen all day. If you’re overweight, learn how calories work and fix it. Find hobbies you can get into and relate to other people about. Video games don’t count. Pick something interesting. Side projects are fine but you need to have a life outside of tech. I have made a lot of friends through my hobbies. Learn to present yourself well. Dress well, practice good hygiene, develop social skills. Don’t be a stereotypical smelly weirdo nerd. All of this is learnable. I was a fucking creature when I first got sober and now I am a well-rounded member of society.  \n**edit**: An addition to this one is pick a high-quality news source such as New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Economist and pay for a subscription. Keep up to date on what's going on in your country and the world so you can talk to others and be part of it. Learn to differentiate between news, opinion pieces, and toxic bullshit that gets shared on social media. Having a political opinion is good but stay away from extremes.\n4. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. I was poisoned by self-pity but the truth is, life is hard and unfair. No one is going to fix your problems for you. And yes, some people are born lucky and everything just falls into their laps. If you want to have a great life you need to go out and build it piece by piece. Let go of your entitled bullshit and accept that you’re going to have to struggle and do things you don’t want to in order to grow and be happy.\n5. Drugs and booze and other vices— many people are able to do these things occasionally and function fine. I am not one of them. You need to be honest with yourself about this. If you go to a party once every few weeks, you’re probably ok. If you’re smoking weed every day, sorry to tell you but you might have a drug problem. Cut that shit out. It will only hold you back. If you are an addict like me the only option is to stop completely. Resources are out there to help you stop.\n6. Don’t live in the past— I can never take back all the pain I caused, the bad choices I made, the injury I got. All I can do is try to make it right and do my best to do better going forward.\n7. Anything is possible. I quit heroin and came back from death. I am a mediocre engineer but very successful because I keep trying. You don’t have to be born special to kick ass, it just takes hustle.\n\n**TLDR:** Started doing drugs, stopped with enormous difficulty, went to school, hustled hard, got a great job",

      "body": "Hi Reddit!\n\nSo, I often get a large number of Bootcamp related questions directly to my inbox, and decided to instead of answering every single one of them, to write an article summarizing my experience as a bootcamp mentor across various programs for +3 years, and someone who's been in the industry for +5 years now and interviews candidates on a daily basis. I was recommended by a Redditor to post my article on r/cscareerquestions. I decided to just post the markdown content as my goal isn't to promote my personal blog and it's instead to help people. Hope it helps some of you!\n\nOn to the article!\n\n# The Good, Bad, and the Ugly of Web Dev Coding Bootcamps.\n\nNot all bootcamps are created equal.\n\nSo…**Coding Bootcamps**. Calling them a controversial way to get into coding as a career path is nothing short of an understatement. Right? Some people love them, some hate them. Some think of them as little more than a quick cash grab to ride the influx of developer roles. Plus, it would explain why the most often received question I get in my inbox is:\n&gt; # What do you think about &lt;insert bootcamp name&gt;? Do you think it’s worth it?\n\nSadly, there is no short answer 🙁 So, in an effort to help all these people on the edge of considering a Coding Bootcamp…I’ve decided to write this article summing up my experiences teaching at bootcamps, seeing students rise and fail, lessons learned, and any tips and advice I’d give to anyone considering a Coding Bootcamp.\n\n## The Good ✅\n\nThe thing Coding Bootcamps excel at the most, is at providing **direction**. Learning how to code can be a daunting, overwhelming task at times. There is so much you need to know, and so much important stuff you can’t possibly know that you don’t know. Bootcamps make this easier by providing a curated learning path.\n\nThe other fantastic thing about bootcamps, is the **community** that often comes along with it. Learning on your own and getting stuck can often be a deeply demoralizing experience. One that changes drastically once you have a whole community behind your back.\n\nThere’s also the **portfolio **of projects aspect. Most bootcamps have a roadmap that lets you end with multiple portfolio projects by the time you graduate. This is the key to landing a full time job with no experience, and probably the hardest part of learning on your own. As you will probably be faced with the common “what do I build?” type of question and end up building nothing.\n\nFor the ones that offer it, there’s also the invaluable **career services** option. For those unfamiliar, this is basically a service for course graduates that helps you find a job, polish your curriculum and social media, and basically does its best to set you up for success. Not too bad!\n\nLastly, there’s the **1:1** **support** which is invaluable as a beginner coder. This is one the biggest things I envy the most as someone who had to learn coding pretty much from scratch (I am not a CS graduate). It’s an incredibly frustrating experience getting stuck for days at a time, only to finally arrive at a random meetup and have a stranger point out a single line of code is to blame. I would not have had to go through so much frustration if I had a 1:1 mentor back in the day.\n\n## The Bad ❌\n\nThere are a **LOT **of **bad** coding bootcamps. I cannot understate this enough. At least in my area, I’ve seen an increasingly large amount of *cheap*, online coding bootcamps. These are made by people who are only out there to cash in the public interest to learn coding, but don’t really care about making you employable. And you can quickly figure this out by just looking at their curriculum.\n\nSome bootcamps barely go into JS/CSS/HTML fundamentals, and then rush you into a React/Angular/Vue app and call it a day. This will **NOT **land you a job. The market is **saturated** with people who know how build a hello world React App but lack the pillars that really make up a developer. Training a person properly takes time, and money. This of course means that a good bootcamp will not be cheap. I’m sorry if that’s not something you were hoping to hear 🙁\n\nThe second thing you need to know before even considering a job in coding, is that you need to make sure you ❤️ this line of work. Nobody really ever tells you that a life in coding, is basically a career where you can never stop learning. And one where sometimes you’ll have to sacrifice free time to stay up to date to current trends in technology if you wish to either stay relevant, or go up the professional ladder. I’ve met a lot of people who joined bootcamps, but were not prepared for the amount of time they had to sacrifice to complete it.\n\nLastly, **time**. Due to the challenging nature of a lot of coding bootcamps, it is important you consider the need of having to put in more hours into the course. This is by far the biggest thing I see catching people off guard. What this means, is that if the bootcamp you are considering asks you for 20 hours a week to complete, be prepared to spend up to 40 hours a week when the going gets tough. If this is impossible to you, I would say find another one with a smaller time commitment that fits better in your time schedule.\n\n## The Ugly 💩\n\nFirst, and possibly the most controversial topic on this article:\n&gt; # You** NEED** to know how to code **BEFORE **joining a coding bootcamp.\n\nI know what you are all thinking. Isn’t that *why* you would join a coding bootcamp? Well, not exactly. The thing about learning how to code from scratch, is that quite frankly…it’s **HARD**. Not to mention every person learns differently both in technique, and at a different pace. This in turn, makes it extremely hard to design course material. Specially when you have to **predict **the specific amount of time it takes to complete, how easy/hard it will be to most people.\n\nWhich results in bootcamps that are either:\n\n* *Easy and a breeze to complete*, but yielding almost no value to students in terms of employability. Meaning you’ll probably have to pay for another course/bootcamp to even be considered for most programing jobs.\n\n* *Hard and challenging*, but with high student drop out rates due to the challenging nature of the course. Of course, this also means that should you not complete the course, you will not be getting a refund.\n\nThese two stereotypes are the reason why even reputable bootcamps always have their fair share of complaints. Such as: the course was too easy, I couldn’t find a job after graduating, or that the course was so hard I always felt like I was drowning and received no help.\n\nHaving said that, as you can probably imagine, only the hard/challenging ones will give you your money’s worth when it comes to becoming a job ready software engineer. However, in order to highly increase your chances of graduating, my recommendation is that you** learn how to code *before* joining a coding bootcamp.**\n\nIn summary: Does this mean there are no good bootcamps? No! There are fantastic bootcamps out there. However, like buying a house or a car, you should do your own research before settling on which one to pick. And I can definitely vouch to there being fantastic coding bootcamps. You just need to find them.\n\n## That’s all folks!\n\nDo I hate bootcamps? Of course not! I work for one after all 😁 at least at the time of writing this article. Still, I’ve received so many messages lately about bootcamps, I felt writing a piece on this was the right step to help people. Hopefully you can pick up the right bootcamp, or if it proves too expensive, maybe hire a private mentor? 👀\n\nUntil next time! 👋 *Adios*!",

      "title": "Started my career in a Big Tech without any DS&amp;A knowledge, focused only on the job, and after 9 YoE can't get a job at another Big Tech (Rant)",
      "body": "Hi! I just wanted to rant a little bit, because I'm kind of tired of what feels like an eternal grind, and my situation as a whole, so here it is...\n\n9 years ago, I (a guy from a regional city from one of the worst schools ever) started my career in a Big Tech in Russia. I bombed all the interviews (especially coding, I wasn't practicing Leetcode at all), but got hired as a Junior Engineer due to my rizz, my ability to work a lot, and some interesting projects to show (social network, audio fingerprints matcher). It was an unusual hire for this company, because they usually hire very smart people who solve lots of Leetcode and compete in CS and Math Olympiads. But I got there somehow. I took the chance, and worked my ass off, trying to be the best around, always working overtime (and a little bit on the weekend), doing everything my manager asks. After around 5 years I got promoted to a Senior role, and after around 2 years more I got promoted to Staff with an opportunity to lead a new product and a small team. Now I earn pretty well, like a lot, and I fell like I've set up a really good life for myself and my wife.\n\nHowever, I'm a very competitive and ambitious person, and I always thought that my next step will be working in a Big Tech company abroad, like Google or Meta, and I was dedicating my life to learn the craft of software development. But I guess I was blind and totally missed the interview preparation phase during all those years, working on my company problems instead and getting promotions. So when I tried interviewing, and couldn't pass the screenings in any big tech (I tried Uber, Meta, Google), I understood that life was hinting me that I do something incorrectly. It's obvious now, but I just didn't practice for interviews at all.\n\nSo I've been trying to fix this mistake for the past 2 years by studying Leetcode and systems design 2 hours before my job starts daily. And only 3 months ago I started to see results, finally passing screening and next interviews in Meta and Microsoft for Senior roles. Still can't get an offer, but it's better at least. Now after all those years I can finally see how much I don't know, and I understand that with my ambitions I should've built my career differently.\n\nHere are my lessons (They seem kind of obvious, but anyways):\n\n\\- **If you work a lot and you are praised, you aren't improving your hire chance for other companies, so start learning DS&amp;A and SD the moment you get your first job**. There's a pretty hard technical bar for interviews and you need to study long and hard to be able to pass it. Even if you are very persistent and can diligently study without interruptions, you can't cram this whole process in a couple of months, or even a year, or even 2 in my experience. In this industry you are expected to study DS&amp;A and SD whenever you start your job. Instead of caring about your YoE (Years of experience), you should actually care about you YoISE (Years of Interview Study Experience). The only good thing about YoE and being promoted is that you'll have easier time getting interview invitations, but it doesn't matter if you can't pass them\n\n\\- **Your manager will not tell you the right direction for your career.** They want you to stay with your company forever and not even think about interviewing in other companies at all. Even if you are friends with them and you celebrate your birthdays together. They might decide to just not talk about your career growth outside of your company for their own personal gain. I was telling them about my ambitions and my interview struggles on our 1x1, but their only response was \"can I give you more challenging tasks here, so that you'll get good?\" Man, I don't buy this stuff anymore, and honestly it sounds treacherous to me.\n\n\\- **Find good people you can share your problems with**. So I come from a place, where being good at math sucked and you were bullied for it. And people around were just cruising their life, never really wanting to accomplish anything apart from having a child. And I was thinking big and my priorities were just different. Because of that I got a habit of not trusting the judgement of others, only trusting my own personal internal voice (because their judgement would've just lead to their dream life, which I don't like), and some time later down the road, my internal voice started to fail me. My personal vision was much better than the vision of the people from my home, but not good enough compared to the collective vision of really good senior folks in our industry and this subreddit. And I wish I'd have a mentor that I could've trusted, who could've pointed on my mistakes. But around you there are some really good senior engineers who'll give really good advice if you get to know them better\n\n\\- **If you think you are pretty good and you peaked, you are lying to yourself**. Because I was getting pretty good results, I always thought of myself as of a clever person, and everybody around me were telling me that. Some time down the road I started to tell it to myself too. Well, it's obviously false, because our industry is so vast and if you know everything, that means you can replace current Google CTO or something like that. Big tech interviews will gladly give you a reality check, don't be afraid to take it. I feel sad now, because I can finally see that I was basically pleasing my ego instead of facing the hard truth and getting actually good.\n\n\\- **Interviewers are looking for candidates who prioritize quality over quantity**. Because I've tried to outwork my colleagues, I worked on a lot of tasks, prioritizing quantity over quality. Somehow I've developed a habit to just bash the problem with my head a lot of times, redoing everything until I like the result. The better habit (and what is expected in the interviews) is to think a lot and plan everything, and then do it really well the first time around. In my personal estimations, I was always on top of my team and I was doing 1.5 times more work than others, but this was not because I was smart, it was because I was spending extra work hours and I knew the codebase pretty well. In a unfortunate turn of events, my incorrect approach really mattered in my role and my manager praised me for that, motivating me to continue doing what I'm doing. But in the interview, your time is super limited, and you can't redo the result until you like it, spending extra hours, so you need to be smart.\n\n\\- **Don't go with the approach of solving lots of Leetcode questions, and looking for solutions if you are aiming high.** If you are just starting Leetcode (or Systems Design), the general opinion is that you should struggle for 40 minutes, and then look at the solution. Well, if you only have 3 months to prepare and you already have DS&amp;A experience or it's 2020, then it's a perfect approach. But It didn't work for me. I did it for 6 months, and the next 6 months I've plateaued without any real progress. I've had all the tools I need, but my problem solving was ass. Colin Galen, the donut youtuber guy, helped me a lot with his advice on never looking at the solution, and on studying a single question very diligently. Thanks a lot for that! I guess I was trying to go fast, never truly understanding things, but what I really needed was to study fundamentals slow. So study slow, and the speed will come naturally. Especially in the current market of Seniors, where you just can't fake it, you need to actually be good. Only go to the next question when you've fully understand it and you've answered all of your own questions like \"why this works?\", \"how can I come up with this solution?\".\n\nSo yeah, folks. Work hard, but in the right direction, and this direction is to study for the interviews. I hope that somebody can relate, and that it'll help them adjust their direction. As for me, I will gitgud, and hopefully some time down the road, I'll make another post, happy this time!\n\nPeace and thanks for reading. What an interesting world we live in!",

See CTCI's \"Before the Interview\" section. I'd also echo [the advice given in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1bq2gu7/i_am_a_former_metagoogle_recruiter_i_think_lot_of/). I used [AwesomeCV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) and a sans-serif font (sourcesanspro). I initially had a low response rate, so I continuously updated my resume until the responses picked up.  \n\n- Metrics are your friend: Quantifiable metrics are easily digestible and give you **some** way to measure impact. IMO, they should be sprinkled into your resume. Don't add useless metrics just for the sake of it.\n\n- Avoid lying. Exaggerating metrics is one thing, lying wholesale about things that you can potentially be grilled on is a recipe for disaster\n\n- Avoid relying wholly on GPT. GPT-generated resumes can slip past HR, but HMs can smell the BS from a mile away. In my experience, GPT can be incredible helpful. I used it to rephrase existing entries. \n\nExample prompts:\n\n1. I'm a backend developer that currently designs, builds, and maintains microservices for XYZ services. \n    I'm looking for other, more generalized, backend roles. In my current role, I've {in-depth description of my accomplishments/tasks}. \n    Below is a sample 'work experience' section of my resume. Provide a bulleted list of suggestions for improvements for each of the entries.\n2. I think that this entry is a bit convoluted. How can I rephrase this in a way that is understandable by recruiters, who may not be very technically inclined, \n        but conveys experience beyond what's expected of a mid-level developer?\n\n---\n\n## Finding Jobs  \n\n- I relied on LinkedIn and company career pages to find job postings. My goal was to be one of the first applicants, not necessarily to find the role where I'd be a best fit. I never cold-contacted recruiters or HMs, and used the same resume for every application.\n\n- I don't live in any major tech hub, and I was willing to relocate to one if the number was right. Remote/Hybrid/On-site didn't matter to me.\n\n-  LinkedIn: I found LI pretty useful once I added lots of \"NOT\" conditions to remove some of the spam from high volume posters, recruiting agencies, and senior-level posts. The search was limited to the last 24 hours and 'Most Relevant' posts. 'Most Recent' posts resulted in no results for some reason \n\t- Ex: `Software Engineer NOT \"Senior\" NOT \"Staff\" NOT \"Principal\" NOT \"Sr\" NOT \"Lead\"...`  \n\n- Company Career Pages: I had bookmarks for specific companies' job boards with the filters ready, and checked them for postings throughout the day. Workday butchered my resume, so I just kept the entries ready in a separate doc so I could easily copy and paste them each time I made a new account. I limited myself to companies that were hiring lots of mid-levels.\n\n---\n\n## Tech Screens  \n\n### Before the Interview\n\n#### Research\n\nYour recruiter may give you some resources with info on the company, its values, etc, to help you prepare. **Go through them and take notes**. Take a look at your set of commonly asked behavioral questions and note how you can incorporate some of the values the company promotes into them.  \n\n#### Intros\n\nSee CTCI's \"Behavioral Questions\" section. Have a basic introduction script for when you're asked \"Tell me about yourself\", and rehearse it. \n\n- Ex: \"I'm Shower_Handel, I've been a software developer for about 3 years now. I started in 2020 as an intern at $company1 as a full-stack developer for $company1's ABC team, where I helped build applications to support DEF across the company. I converted to full-time after I graduated, and remained there until I joined $company2 in 2022 as a full-stack developer.  $company2 provides services for XYZ. I primarily work on the backend, but I wear a lot of hats since our team is pretty small, so I work across every part of the stack. I'd like to continue to learn and grow, and hope to do that at $interviewingCompany.\" \n\n### Coding Rounds\n\nSee CTCI's \"Technical Questions\". What I did basically boiled down to a few things:\n\n 0. Ask clarifying questions. Go over input constraints\n\n 1. Think out loud: Explain your entire thought process \n\n 2. Write the pseudocode and explain each step\n\n 3. Write the solution, and don't give up if it doesn't work. If the interviewer gives you the option to ask some questions or to try to finish the solution, try to finish.  \n\n 4. Have a basic set of questions ready for the interviewer that signal interest in the company as a whole, the team specifically, and show that you want to continue to learn and grow. You should have enough questions to fill the rest of the meeting time after completing the coding portion. Get all of your questions answered, even if you have to stay past the scheduled time (unless either of you have a hard stop). Try to call back to things the interviewer mentioned during their intro. Signaling interest in the team is extremely important IMO, and it's something that I don't see advised very often. A recruiter let me know that I failed to do this during an onsite, which was part of the reason I didn't get an offer\n\t- Ex:\n\t\t- Company-specific: How does $company foster a culture of innovation?  \n\t\t- Team-specific: You mentioned the team is involved in XYZ. Can you go into more detail? \n\t\t- For the HM: How do you develop your engineers?\n\n### Take-Homes\n\n- For take-homes that are within reason, give it your all, but limit the amount of time spent to 6-8 hours. This means adding tests, writing some documentation, etc.  \n- I had a mixed experience with take-homes. I refused one-way HackerRank/Codility/HireVue invites for coding tests unless I had met a team member (HR didn't count). Being asked to invest my time without any buy-in from the team itself gave me a poor impression. I also refused any egregious take-homes. \n\t- Ex: An HM asked me to plan, build, and deploy a scalable, public-facing, high-volume application within 48 hours, complete with documentation. No thanks.\n\t- YMMV. I found that companies that sent one-way tests were typically smaller/mid-sized and weren't worth the effort, but I wasn't desperate for another role.\n\n### Technical Discussions  \n\nI had a few Technical Discussion rounds where interviewers gauged my understanding of backend systems and technologies. These were not system design rounds (no whiteboard).  \nDuring these rounds, questions were mostly about common microservice design/reliability/monitoring patterns:  \n\n- Ex scenario:  Let's say you have two containerized services: $service1 and $service2. Both are hosted on separate machines. We have ownership of both services and can modify them as needed.  \n\n - What would you do to ensure that, if $service2 went down, that $service1 wouldn't keep trying to make requests to it? \n  \n - Are there any service communication patterns you could use to improve the chance of $service1 successfully sending requests to $service2, even if $service2 is very busy / slow to respond? \n  \n - As a downstream service, how could you ensure that $service2 doesn't get flooded with requests from $service1? \n  \nThere's a wealth of platform-agnostic information in the [Microsoft Azure docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/)  that really helped me fill the gaps. The entire Application Architecture Fundamentals section is a goldmine.    \n\n### System Design\n\nI had a few System Design rounds as well. Not much on my end to add here, except that CTCI has a great chapter on this.\n\n\n### After the Interview\nImmediately after every interview, take notes and go over 2 things while they are still fresh in your mind:  \n \n- What you did well / what the interviewers liked.\n  - Ex: I was able to answer all the interviewer's questions about building scalable microservices. The interviewer was satisfied with my answers about ensuring reliability. I probably don't need to focus on this as much as other topics.  \n- Where you needed to improve and how you should do so. \n\t - Ex: During the last system design round, the interviewer pointed out some issues with the way I planned the database layer. I should read up on database schema design and best practices.  \n\n---\n\n## Overall\nLC is still important. I did at least a few problems each week to keep myself sharp, but behavioral performance is equally important. In my experience, I wasn't expected to be a technical expert, but someone who was easy to work with, could admit that they were wrong, and showed genuine interest in the team, company, and the role.",

          "body": "Really good stuff in here, thanks for taking the time to write and share.\n\nI'm in a somewhat similar position (\\~3 years experience, just wrapped up a 6+ month long job search) and just wanted to throw in my two cents for anyone reading and still looking:\n\n1. May be obvious to some, but I didn't realize until two months in that I can (and should) apply to a company multiple times. Sometimes it would be the second, third, or even fourth application with a company that would get me a call back. So if the company rejects you and you see another posting that seems like a good fit, apply!\n2. It might be my background but I found you can get a call back even if you only hit around 1/4 the desired skills in the listing. I had callbacks for listings that asked for 6+ years of experience, and for listings where I didn't have any experience with any of the desired tech stack experience listed. YMMV but if the job sounds interesting and somewhat relevant, apply even if you don't meet the requirements.\n3. When it comes to grinding LC be honest with yourself. I suck at that part of interviews and I know that, so I spent several hours a day grinding LCs for months. If you suck at LCs (like me), you'll need to grind. And that's okay. [This is my heatmap](https://imgur.com/a/j6c0ZlC) from while I was prepping - and even after all this I was still choking on algo interviews from time to time. And OP still makes a great point - don't grind LCs at the exclusion of all other prep, you still should be practicing for the behavioral portion and sys. design (if you have 2+ years experience).\n4. [This guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eKirumpmwDWTtKCJKn2HuoQ2NavEfR41whmTyaQcio4/mobilebasic#) was a great help to me. I highly recommend going through it and taking what you need from it. For me it was timing myself, and keeping track of how long it takes me to understand a problem, to come up with the brute force, etc.\n\nAgain, thanks OP for sharing and congrats on the offer! And for everyone reading this and still looking, that offer is going to happen - don't give up hope, loose focus, or be too hard on yourself! Good luck!",

      "title": "I was fired from my first programming position, went through unemployment, now I work at a Big N. Some advice for people who are \"worried\"",
      "body": "Bio Plug: Graduated with non CS engineering degree from a high ranking school. Hated the field once I worked in it. Visited a friend who was working at a growing SAAS company, now works at Amazon. Loved the environment. Younger people, happy, always new stuff talked about. Studied programming on my own. Passed an interview test, they realized they needed someone more experienced two weeks after I started and fired me after I spent my savings relocating. I was devastated.  \nI've also gone through working at a start-up who VC's pulled out from, working at a contractor that started firing veteran employees because management lost a 7 figure contract and now I work at a Big N.  \nHere's my advice for the people going through the following stressful situations/tragedies -  \n**TLDR Advice -  \nFor job hunters:  \n1. Send out as many applications as you can, even to positions you don't qualify for and the ones you match the most, pay more attention to.  \n2. Try to divide your time between accomplishable studying goals and applying.  \n3. Be willing to relocate even if you have family, close friends, SO.  \n4. Relax and don't blame yourself.  \nFor those working that are worried or wondering if there's problems:  \n1. Got a bad feeling in your gut? Listen to it.  \n2. There's nothing wrong with putting a value on loyalty.  \n3. Communicate with your boss when you're unhappy, albeit professionally.**  \nDetailed -  \n**For those trying to get a first job, that seem to never see the end of rejections**:  \n1. Send out as many applications as you can, even to positions you don't qualify for and the ones you match the most, pay more attention to.  \nI sent out *hundreds* of applications. And when I found a position I really matched, I made the application as personal as I can, often naming the engineering manager in my email, pointing out my knowledge about tech they use and discussing their portfolio directly and relating it to my knowledge.  \nIt sucks when you make an application personal and they don't acknowledge you, but it's worthwhile experience learning to talk about the tech for future interviews and it *also* sucks for them, to turn down someone who made things so personable.  \n2. Try to divide your time between accomplishable studying goals and applying. Pick an MOOC, and ONE only, and spend half your time applying to jobs and the other half on conquering that MOOC. Don't even LOOK at other classes on Coursera until that MOOC is finished and you've completed the final project.  \nI did a complete book on a platform I know, and I even did an iTunes University course on DS&amp;algorithms. I never moved on until I finished one.  \nBy the time I started my first real job after being fired, I had finished 5 courses and knew the in's and out's of my platform enough to talk about it in regular conversation.  \n3. Be willing to relocate. Some of you have family, or a girlfriend, or a close group of friends. I'm sorry to tell you this, but you are more of a burden to them than help if you're unemployed especially in the US. The US is harsh and brutal to people unemployed. More so nowadays than before.  \nIf you relocate, get a job in a low COL, you can save money for plane tickets, fly your SO to come see you, learn more about the world outside of what you know and get experience to come back later.  \nI really wanted to work in my college city, so badly that I was willing to take a 20% cut in pay under market rate to do it. That would've been a massive mistake.  \nNow, I get job offers for my college city 20 to 30% above what I earn now because I've earned experience and I'm in demand.  \nI've lived in three different cities after I graduated because I kept going where the work is.  \nYou would be surprised what a company will do for you if you're the best person for the job that they can afford. Early termination lease fees, rental truck, plane ticket, crate for your dog, groceries and beer money for two weeks? Done.  \nIt's true that my first job fired me, I'll talk about that soon. But the next three companies? Hired me, helped me move, took care of my expenses.  \n4. Relax and don't blame yourself. No, you're not a shitty programmer. No, you're not \"worthless\" compared to your friend who got hired by Facebook pre-graduation.  \nThere are literally *thousands* of alumni and bootcamp graduates just like you having trouble getting placed. A lot of companies want Gilfoyle at McDonald's employee prices and it's showing. Companies think that if they hold out enough, they can get some guy who passes all their HackerRank tests who will be okay with $50,000 a year and be grateful because the economy sucks.  \nIn reality, they're just going to sit around with a job posting for programmers and complain that engineers ask for too much money. Forget about those places, you wouldn't want to work there anyway.  \nFocus on the companies that can afford you and deserve you.  \nBut take time after a busy day of applying and studying to just relax. Go to a friend's house, watch some movies, do yoga, play your favorite game and turn off messages and emails for an hour while you do it. This job is stressful and if you build in this sense of urgency and panic and engrain it too much, you will have trouble relaxing in the future and put yourself at risk for very serious heart conditions.  \n**For those who have a job and are unsure about going for something else, how safe their office is or worried about getting fired**:  \n1. Got a bad feeling in your gut? Listen to it.  \nIs there a guy/girl that works with you that acts like you should never complain about management, work is work and management never does anything wrong?  \nYeah, fuck that guy. That guy is an idiot and in a year or two, you'll be twilights and galaxies ahead of him/her in your career because they would sit around on the titanic playing the violin while you're clawing your way into a life raft.  \nThere's *NOTHING* wrong with listening to your gut. It doesn't mean you're going to quit if you start asking serious questions and start wondering what's going on with the weather forecast.  \nMy first company was a start-up. At a certain point, I noticed the founders would go into meeting rooms and not invite any of us. I got a little worried so I started asking my PM for meetings and asking my mentor if I should be worried.  \nMy coworker on another platform kept saying, \"Dont' worry about it we just need to do our job\". Total company man.  \nI decided it's better to be safe than sorry and it's better to have job offers I can turn down than be in the middle of the woods with explosive diarrhea and not a tissue in sight.  \nSo I started putting out feelers with recruiters, I took on five interviews and I had four hard offers for local companies, all at a minimum of $5,000 over my current salary.  \nAt the end of that month, founders dragged us all into a meeting room and told us they lost funding and half of us were gonna be fired and they wanted the engineers to work pro-bono for a few weeks on like a \"salary IOU\" while they try to package up our platform and sell it.  \nCompany man next to me? He had the same look on his face that my friends had when we walked out of a hard calculus 3 final that they bombed and I talked through all my solutions in confidence because the questions were exactly like the ones I got in TA hours, that they skipped because of how much smarter than me they were.  \nLuckily for that asshole, who treated me like shit because I wanted to cover my ass, I actually gave his information \"anonymously\" to the same recruiter who placed me and told her, \"Hit him up and be persistent, he's a good coder he just doesn't see the writing on the walls\". My recruiter landed him a position and to this day he doesn't know how the recruiter found him.  \n2. There's nothing wrong with putting a value on loyalty.  \n[This is what I have to say about loyalty, per Dwight Schrute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QWsTBvXx_g). Care about you and you only.  \nLike your boss? Like your office? Say things like, \"I don't want another job because unlike you guys, I commit to the place I work\". Let me ask you this, will your boss come to your house and carry you to the bathroom when you're retired? Will your boss drive you to pick up groceries when your car breaks down?  \nYour company, in the US, only cares about you as much as your value proceeds the worth of your compensation and training. Once those values do not align, *the clock is ticking and you will likely be fucked over soon*. That's the advantage \"at will\" employment gives them.  \nThey can fire you and unless they tell you publicly, \"I'm firing you because of the color of your skin\", you likely have very little recourse to correct it.  \nAnd they can literally fire you with less than 24 hours notice.  \nYour lifestyle? Dependent on your salary? Unemployment insurance is likely a fraction of that amount, so firing you can literally put your life and livelihood in danger.  \nAlways have a back up plan even if you don't feel like your company is in danger.  \nSpeak to recruiters, build relationships with other companies in your cities. Always have someone or some company who thinks, \"Man, it'd be nice to have code_4_you here working with us, let's see how he/she is doing\". Those connections are your natural parachutes and help you to not have to relocate again.  \n3. Communicate with your boss when you're unhappy, albeit professionally.  \nThere is nothing wrong with not being sure about what you're doing. Sometimes your boss won't even know there's something wrong. A lot of managers, albeit this is a mistake and any managers reading should pay attention to this and not do it, don't tell their engineers the small combination of words that will make over 40% of them feel happy and STOP looking for new jobs -  \n\"You're doing great, we're really glad to have you here, this is some of the stuff we have planned next year for you.\"  \nThat's it. Literally 8 seconds of English words and your engineers will feel safe, secure and stop hitting up your competitors for back-up plans.  \nThat's what my boss said to me two months ago, and now I'm working the longest streak at one company of my career.  \nIf you don't feel that way, tell your boss, because this paper trail gives you the defense you need to show that you DID try to communicate your dissatisfaction. And it's possible they will try to remedy it by changing your project, putting you under a new senior or offering you some extra PTO to sort things out.  \nMy story:  \nAdapt is the theme of my experience. I was fired, I adapted. I got a job and had a bad feeling about the VC's/founders, I adapted. I got hired by a contractor and had a feeling there was toxicity in upper level management, finally felt ready to work for a Big N, I adapted.  \nNow I love what I do and I'm highly valuable.  \nGood luck out there!  \nOh and if anyone tries to convince you that we don't deserve these six figure salaries or earning more money than most of their clerical staff/management and tries to say, \"This market isn't sustainable, software engineers are asking too much and companies bleed trying to hire them\", tell them to fuck off.  \nThat's not how economics work.  \nWe are in such demand that literally other countries are trying to fly us out of the country and offering us crazy immigration and visa conditions to get us to go there.  \nThis is a software driven world and it's only going to get better. Self driving cars, smart underwear, more powerful phones... All this shit needs engineering. If you don't want to pay for a good engineer, buy a Safari Books subscription or build a fucking Wordpress site.  \nI'm sick of these red pill, economics/management science graduates trying to sneak into /r/CSCareerQuestions and trying to neg us down because they failed to hit their hiring quota for their \"IT\" department, because a UCLA CS graduate didn't want to accept their \"excellent\" offer of $55,000 a year to build their Enterprise Tinder clone or whatever shit idea they think they know more about than us.

      "body": "**Need some career advice (and maybe personal life advice too).**\n\nI moved to DFW a few years ago, my family relocated here, my wife got a job offer right out of college, and I had just finished my military service. I went to college here, bought a house, and landed my first SWE job at a Fortune 500 company (3+ years of experience now).\n\nFinancially, things have gone well. My wife and I have been able to build a lot of wealth here, and life has been good—though never fully satisfying. Every summer we end up flying back to California to see her family and our friends.\n\n**Numbers:**\n\n* My comp this year: $115k salary + $15k bonus\n* Wife’s comp: $117k salary, fully remote\n* Extra income: \\~$27k/year VA disability\n\nThe issue: I’m not really satisfied with my job anymore. At first, we had a great project, but over time poor leadership, endless contractors, and unclear vision drove morale down. A lot of people have quit, and the work just isn’t fulfilling anymore.\n\nI’ve looked for other opportunities in DFW, but most of the stronger roles seem to be back in the Bay Area. My company has a Palo Alto office, and a role opened up there. I interviewed, got the offer, and negotiated $140k base salary with $5k relocation. It’s a lateral transfer, but my wife’s salary likely won’t adjust upward since she’s remote and her company considers it a voluntary transfer.\n\nWe’ve always talked about moving back to the Bay long term, and now feels like the time. We want to start a family soon, and we’d have family support both here and there. We have no debt (cars paid off, no student loans), just a mortgage. The plan would be to rent out our house here through a property management company—not for profit, just to hold onto it. In the Bay, we’d rent something modest and avoid buying.\n\nWe know the cost of living will be higher, but the goal has always been to return to California. This transfer seems like the best option since I haven’t had luck with external offers. I’m also hoping to get more exposure to new tech by being there.\n\nDo you think we’re in the right headspace about this move? Would appreciate any thoughts or advice.\n\n**EDIT**:\n\n1. Is it also worth a move in this job market? The new team is a small team with a new project, I don't anticipate instability, but I know the job market is absolutely brutal right now...\n2. We have an emergency fund that is about a years worth\n\n  \n**EDIT 2** :\n\n1. Would still be getting (per recruiter) bonus &amp; performance raise in February when company gives it",

      "body": "Edit: Wow! Did not expect this kind of reaction. Thanks everyone!\n\nEdit 2: btw I started a site for engineers [CareerDean](https://www.careerdean.com)\n\nHello redditors, \n\nMost of the advice on this subreddit is about how to get a job in the perspective of a job seeker. It is usually good advice, but thought it would be interesting to share how companies/hiring managers/executives think. By knowing how they think, it will be easier to convince them to give you a job. or at least thats my hope!! :)\n\nps. it's kinda long....but hopefully its worth it. It came out to over 2600 words!\n\nMy background: I’m a CEO of a venture-backed startup in San Francisco. I’ve interviewed and hired a lot of engineers in the past. I also have a lot of friends who are founders/CEOs/Executives of companies in Silicon Valley so I feel I have a good sense on what they are thinking in terms of recruiting engineers. \n\nHowever, I will say I have never been a hiring manager for a large corporation. I do think the thought process is very similar, but do take what I say with a grain of salt as it may not apply to all companies. Even within startups and medium-sized companies, the thought process may different between organizations. :)\n\nAnyways, this post won’t be too structured. I am just going to list off a bunch of things we hiring managers think of and give practical advice based on it. Sorry for any grammatical or syntax errors in advance. Ima go fast!\n\n(if you have any follow up questions or want to chat or anything, would love to help. just ping me!)\n\n-We are under the impression that hiring good software engineers is EXTREMELY difficult because everybody wants good software engineers. Some job seekers, especially college students or recent grads, think that getting a job is EXTREMELY difficult because companies have all the leverage. It is all about who the COMPANY chooses. But in our minds, it is all about who the ENGINEERS choose. \n\nThe demand for engineers is crazy right now. As a CEO, I see it everyday. Everyone wants to hire engineers, but there aren’t enough of them.  \n\nOk, so what does this mean for you the job seeker? It means that you actually have a lot more leverage than you think you do. There are not that many of you out there, so act like it. I think one thing a candidate can do to lower his or her chances at getting a job is seeming desperate. Sucking up too much or saying things like, “Oh my god, thank you so much for even giving me an interview. You have no idea what this means to me” can actually go against you. Why? Because it makes you look desperate. And as a hiring manager, I’ll start to question you. “Everybody wants to hire software engineers, but why are you desperate? You must really not be good.” That sounds harsh, but trust me, a lot of people think like that. You always want what you can’t have. \n\nSo practical advice? Don’t seem desperate. Know that you have a lot of leverage. Know that software engineers are essential for tech companies. Know that if you are a good engineer, companies should be lucky they have you, not the other way around. Knowing this will exude a kind of confidence that will want companies to even want you more. But you can’t be a douchebag about it. Please. I’d rather hire a desperate person than someone who thinks they own the company. \n\n(well, there goes all my negotiating leverage….)\n\n\n-One of the main reasons we are hesitant on hiring an engineer is because we simply don’t know (and so can’t trust) the engineer. \n\nYou’ve probably heard that recruiting is a lot like dating. Well guess what, it’s really true. Hiring a full-time employee is a bigger commitment for a company than you may think. It is not all about the money you will have to pay in salaries. This person is not part of a team that will depend on her/him. This person will be representing the company to the public. This person will know the secrets of the company. This person will form relationships with members of your company. And much much more. (If you think of it that way, a salary is really not that big of a deal)\n\nWill you ever marry someone that you have only known for 3 days? probably not. You may think the person is the most amazing person ever, but the truth is, you have too much to lose from taking that risk without really being able to trust the person. Same with recruiting.\n\nWithout knowing a person well, it’s hard to trust him/her. You don’t know if this person will leave in 3 months. You don’t know if this person actually is as good as the resume proclaims. YOu don’t know how this person reacts in tough situations. \n\nSo if you truly believe you are an amazing engineer but are having a hard time getting an offer, you may want to ask yourself, how can I get the company to trust me? Honestly, any company that trusts you and believes you are good engineer will immediately make an offer to you (assuming they have enough money, a position for you, etc.)\n\nSo how can you get a company to trust you? Most of it has to do with networking. Some practical tips:\n\n1. Go to your schools career fairs and talk to the recruiters there. Meeting face-to-face builds a level of trust/relationship that can’t be built via a resume or online. I’m sure its scientifically proven. :p\n2. Get intros to hiring managers. \n3. Follow people on social media or respond to tweets, posts, etc. This can help start a relationship.\n4. Before applying to a company, figure out who the hiring manager is (or just someone at the company), find their email, and ask them if you can buy them coffee. Build a relationship this way and get a referral. \n5. Realize there are no golden rules of networking like there is no golden rules of dating. To marry someone, you want to build a solid relationship. Be creative and figure out ways to build relationships with hiring managers or people at companies you want to work for.\n\nMany people have told you that you need to network to get a job. But have you ever wondered why it is necessary? It’s really about trust. Doing the above will help build a relationship prior to a job application process which makes you more trustworthy. \n\n\n-Yes, if available, we will Google you and look at your online presence. We will try to find out what kind of person you are. \n\nYou guys probably knew this, but it is true, people will look you up on Google. They will find your twitter, stack overflow, github, linkedin, etc. Make sure these are optimized. In fact, in today’s age, I would argue your social presence is WAY more important than your resume. I look at a resume for 3 seconds to see if I want to look them up online. I decide from online presence whether I want to pursue the relationship further .\n\nThis actually also goes back to the last point. Make sure the things you have available online are things that will make you seem more trustworthy (and also talented. for example, having an awesome github REALLY does help)\n\n\n\n-We want to hire someone that WANTS to work for our company. And it’s pretty easy to know if you are lying, so if you lie, do it well. \n\nThis one is pretty straight-forward. All hiring managers want to hire someone who WANTS to be there, not just collect a paycheck. We understand that a majority of people don’t care about their jobs as much as we do and just want a steady paycheck. That is fine. i TOTALLY understand but if that is you, you’ve at least got to pretend you care. If you are going to ‘lie,’ do it well.\n\nExamples of what NOT to do:\n\n1. Did you know when you apply to a company on AngelList (angel.co), the company can actually see how many other companies you applied to? Sometimes I get cover letters on AngelList that say something like “Dear hiring manager (btw, never say that), I would love to work at your company. It is absolutely my number one choice and would do whatever it takes to help it succeed……….and on……” However, AngelList also shows that this person also applied to 200+ companies. Now I commend you on having a ‘personalized’ cover letter, but it’ really doesn’t work. As a hiring manager, I am inclined to think you said the same thing to all 200+ other companies. I really am not a fan of applying to too many companies (I think you should focus on a handful), but if you must, don’t apply via AngelList or other sites that reveal the number of companies you applied to. Find out what companies are hiring on AngelList and then just email them so the company doesn’t know you are applying to 200+ companies. \n2. Tell someone you REALLY want to work for their company, but not know very much about the company. If you REALLY want to work for a company, you would have done a lot of research.\n\n\n\n-We would much rather take someone who is a culture fit and not as talented as opposed to someone who is talented, but a complete culture misfit.\n\nI can’t stress how important culture fit is. For you experienced people, I think you can agree. Even the best software engineer can negatively impact a team/company. Doesn’t matter if you are really good, if you can’t gel or work together with your teammates, the company will be worse off. \n\nWhat’s that mean for you as a job seeker? Make sure you know the culture of the company and work on your interpersonal skills. \n\n\n-We will stereotype you based on your resume, online presence, behaviors, and everything else. So know how to play the game!\n\nI am going to give a geeky example (please forgive me!). Let’s say you are a heavy Starcraft player. As a heavy gamer, you probably have some stereotype of how a GOOD Starcraft player behaves. By just having a conversation with someone, you can probably gauge their skill level. By looking at their previous stats, you can gauge their skill level. By knowing what kind of friends they have, you can gauge their skill level. You are essentially stereotyping them based on their resume, online presence, behaviors, and everything else. \n\n(btw. I am not a gamer. I don’t play Starcraft, though my brother is a pro. For those who play Starcraft, I bet you probably knew I didn’t play Starcraft by my last paragraph. Im assuming by just how I spoke about the game, you know I am not familiar with it. You just stereotyped me! But I do play a lot of basketball. I play so much, that I can usually gauge skill level based on their conversation, clothing, how they walk, etc. Am I always right? no, but if someone doesn’t know what a ‘eurostep’ is, it’s likely they aren’t good.)\n\nHiring managers do the very same thing. Here are some examples:\n\n1. listing irrelevant jobs on your resume when you are applying for software engineer jobs (eg. Starbucks barista). Does having the barista position automatically mean you are not a good software engineer? Of course not! But a good one usually wouldn’t, so if you do, a hiring manager may think so based on his or her biases. Is it fair? That’s arguable, but it happens.\n2. Not having a good github. Does not having a github mean you are a terrible programmer? Of course not! But these days, a lot of the best programmers are hackers and open-source enthusiasts who live on Github. It’s possible you are amazing, but from a pure statistical sense, unlikely.\n3. Not knowing what Stack Overflow is. Again, it’s very possible that a good programmer doesnt know of Stack Overflow. But if I had to guess, there’s probably 1 for every 1000. \n\nThese are just some examples. There are plenty of others, just like there may be plenty of things you can stereotype someone on in Starcraft or basketball. It is important to be able to talk and walk like a software engineer. Because the good ones, do. \n\nWhat practical tips can I give to help in this area? Just code a lot and hang out with other programmers. If you want to be a good programmer, you will be doing that anyways. \n\nA mistake is thinking that you will be judged objectively by your resume. Honestly, I would argue your resume doesn’t matter much. Personally, I dont care much at all about your resume. I have some friends who care a little bit. I know no one who cares a lot. You will be judged by a lot more than your resume. \n\n\n-We understand that negotiations are necessary, but if you are not cordial about it, we will get butthurt. \n\nNow to my final point. If you do get an offer, congratulations!! (at this point, you are probably relieved, but I can tell you that companies are sweating hoping you accept. Nothing is more frustrating than investing dozens of hours on interviews, vetting, etc to have the candidate reject you). \n\nIf we could have it our way, would we wish that candidates never negotiated? Of course! haha makes our lives easier. But we know it doesn’t work that way, and it shouldn’t. \n\nI am a bit different on negotiations than some of my friends. Some of my friends purposely offer something lower than they would because they think the candidate will negotiate up to that anyways. Then they are paying what they wanted in the first place! They win!\n\nI’m not a fan of this. I like to offer what I think is fair and not to undercut anyone. I feel business relationships work better that way.\n\nI also know people that think a job seeker should negotiate EVERY offer NO MATTER WHAT. I also disagree with this. I think a job seeker should negotiate sometimes, but its not always necessary. I can’t put a percentage on it because it really depends on the relationship of the person hiring and the job candidate. Is your guys relationship built upon immense mutual respect for one another. Do you trust each other that you will try to do whats fair under any circumstances? Do you both not feel the sense to fight for what’s fair because you know the other party will fight for you already? If that’s the case, it may even be possible for the two parties to come up with a job offer together instead of one party simply offering.\n\nBut if the relationship isn’t as strong (as most isnt), make sure there are two goals of negotiations:\n\n1. Get what is fair, but on the nice side (some people think it is about getting as much as you can. I don’t know if I agree)\n2. Start your new job on good terms.\n\nTrust me, that 5k extra per year is not going to be worth having people bitter at you at work. The same goes for the hiring manager. I would never want the new engineer to feel they were undercut. I would rather pay him an extra 5k. Performance would go up probably anyways to justify it. \n\nIn the end, negotiations is about both parties getting what is fair. \n\nWell, that was very long. But hope that helped!!! And I hope it doesn’t come back to bite me. haha. jk\n\nanyways, if you guys have any further questions, feel free to ask in the comments or just ping me if its more personal. I’m down to chat, google hangout, whatever.\n\nBest of luck everyone!!\n",

I think the last time this happened, that person was getting hate mail and had some truly horrible things said to them in the comments.\n\nBy the time I get home from work, I have about 4 hours and I still have to eat dinner and go to the gym in that time. That doesn't leave me much time to work on projects and as a result, I have no Github. Come the weekend, I'm out in the woods without a computer, at a museum, at a show with my partner, etc. I don't have the time, energy, nor will to devote more than a couple hours a week to something and that something is currently reviewing the data structures and algorithms everyone asks about in interviews. So now that I've been at my current job ~2 years, I feel stuck. I'm not exposed to new technologies so I don't get many callbacks. When I do get callbacks, the person on the phone is incredibly disappointed I don't have a fantastic Github.\n\nSo I guess my question is, do you still look for these sorts of things on someone's resume if they have experience? Am I doomed to mediocre corporate jobs where they don't care about daily OSS contributions in your free time? If there's such a shortage of engineers, are the interesting problems I solve at work enough? Is it also that much a negative if I don't have an active online presence now that I have some experience? I think most of the advice that gets posted on /r/cscareerquestions is aimed at new grads and people looking for internships, so I always like hearing advice for people later in their career too (even if I'm not at that point yet).",

The lack of gender and age diversity in Silicon Valley companies now is a known issue, and I believe that much of the problem is linked companies trying to hire candidates that they see as a fit within their company's culture.

      "title": "My experience with the IK Prep Program (so far)",
      "body": "EDIT 9/12/23:\n\nI finished the program a bit under a year ago. I was able to get offers of $200k and above. \n\n\nMy opinion stands: Not sure it's completely worth it if you're disciplined enough to leverage cheaper resources. It's not the worst investment as it helped me develop the discipline to grind on my own afterwards. If you still want to do the program after this post, DM me for a referral link (you get $300 off).\n\n\nIf you have the $7k or whatever it costs nowadays and want to invest it in interview prep I recommend the following:\n\nNeetcode.io courses - ~$300\nInterviewing.io interviews - the rest of what you have to spend\n\n\n---\n\n# My Background\n**Experience:** 5 years\n\n**Domain**: iOS\n\n**Salary/TC**: $142k/$155k\n\n**Degree**: N/A, went to a bootcamp\n\n**Prior Interview Prep Experience**: Throughout the years I messed around with going through CTCI, doing some Leetcode, buying resources I never used like AlgoDaily, AlgoExpert, Grokking the Coding Interview, etc. I was unable to get disciplined and serious about interview prep because \"Lol, I already make more money than I ever thought I could make. It's not that serious.\"\n\nSomething was seriously wrong and spending a few hundred on prep didn't really help me aside from just building up my resource bank. I lacked the discipline and it was showing.\n\nFor years recruiters of top companies have been in my LinkedIn inbox trying to recruit me, but I'd either delay or ignore them...being satisfied with the ego stroke that the big companies wanted me to interview with them. Ha. Silly me. It wasn't until I started researching a bit more deeply that I realized that by not prepping I am missing out on a shit ton of money. I mean, some of these top companies are paying nearly double for my experience! That's life changing money twice over! So I knew I had to figure out a way to get disciplined. I decided to put my money where my mouth was and dropped $7k on Interview Kickstart.\n\n# WTF is Interview Kickstart?\nInterview Kickstart is an interview prep program. Moving forward I'll be referring to Interview Kickstart by IK.\n\nIK offers quite a number of specializations such as machine learning, backend, iOS, Android, etc. But that's optional. Their bread and butter is their Data Structures and Algorithms portion. As a mobile engineer, their system design was almost entirely irrelevant, but they offer that as well.\n\nYou can go to their site and look up their specializations, but I'll mainly be going over the DS&amp;A in this post.\n\n# Schedule at IK\nAll material at IK is locked until you reach the date the material is meant to unlock. That date depends on which pace of the program you're in.\n\nYou can take their program in one of three ways:\n\n1. Normal Pace - This is where you cover the topics one week at a time\n2. Extended Pace - This is where you cover the topics every other week\n3. Accelerated Pace - Everything is unlocked and you can progress at your own pace\n\nTheir DS&amp;A curriculum is broken down into:\n\n- Sorting\n- Recursion\n- Trees\n- Graphs\n- Dynamic Programming\n\nEach topic is made up of four fundamental pieces: \n\n- Pre-class Foundational Material (4-5 hours of videos + post-video quizzes)\n- Class (5-7 hours long)\n- Problem Sets (10-20 problems)\n- Test (1 hour to get through 3 questions of varying difficulty)\n\nAfter you go through the course, you'll have what's called a support period of 4-6 months (depending on the pace you choose). Throughout the program you'll also be given 9 or 15 (depending on if you choose a specialization or not) mock interviews which you can schedule whenever you want and it can be on whatever topic you want. \n\nThe support period is the part after you've completed the knowledge part of the course. This is essentially where you'll likely use your mock interviews and grind to refresh your technicals. Like a built-in Leetcode grind but with some support.\n\n# My Experience with IK\nSince I work a full time job, I decided to go with the extended pace because the normal pace would've meant I would have had to sacrifice all of my spare time and the accelerated pace would not have made this program any different than all of the resources I've paid for in the past.\n\nI will say...in retrospect, I should have gone with the normal pace and made that sacrifice upfront. I'm feeling a bit burnt out of doing the program for so long.\n\nUp to this point, I've completed the DS&amp;A and System Design portions.\n\n## DS&amp;A\nHoly shit. This was like drinking from a fire hose. So much information. Just so much to get through. 4-5 hours of foundational material per topic, but it was nice to know exactly what I had to do and when to do it. The foundational material covers the data structure, the theory, the implementation, their operations, and how to apply them to certain problems. After the videos, we're often given short multiple choice quizzes, but these aren't anything ground breaking or anything. Just really testing whether you paid attention.\n\nThen you have class.\n\nClasses are usually 5-7 hours long. Yes, they're recorded and you can access them at a later date, but for the sake of the program's schedule, it's in your best interest to just get it done with.\n\nThe classes throughout all of the sections are really just the instructor walking through his/her thought process while working through 6-7 carefully selected problems. In the class, the instructor often goes over their \"coding framework\" for certain types of problems. You can compare this to how Grokking has their coding patterns, but this is more of a \"template\" to get familiar with so you're not stuck thinking about how to code the \"setup\" in your interviews. This format for the class is followed in nearly every class. Such as how to setup your BFS, DFS, or Graph problems.\n\nAfter the class, your problem sets are unlocked for the week. This is when you'll attempt to work on the problems that were done in class plus 6-8 more questions. That's a lot, but it's great exposure and forced practice. These vary from easy to hard level questions.\n\nThen in a week or so you'll have a test where you'll be tested on what you've gone over. You'll be expected to complete three problems within an hour. No worries if you don't pass. It doesn't mean anything besides checking to see how you're doing with the material. The questions in the tests range from easy to hard.\n\nWe've gone over different techniques for approaching problems such as brute-force, divide and conquer, decrease and conquer, and transform and conquer. We haven't really focused on specific patterns, but more so concepts that help set the foundation for problem solving. Naturally we've gone over BFS, DFS and how they relate to Trees and Graphs, but it's never been a \"Hey, let's focus on the DFS pattern.\"\n\n## System Design\nAs a mobile engineer, this was almost entirely irrelevant to me. It was nice to see what backend folks have to deal with, but this was just such a huge waste of my time that after 4-5 hours I went and looked for my own mobile specific resources. No regrets there.\n\nBut for those who are interested....they follow a similar format to the above, really. Shit ton of information and they go pretty in depth. \n\n# Is It Worth The $7K?\nThis is hard to say at the moment. I've yet to go through the iOS domain portion, but if I get a job offer that's more than a $7k increase over what I'm making, it will technically have been worth it. But so far, I think I can say that if I hadn't spent the money I'd probably still be lolly-gagging.\n\nBut if I was going to end up spending the $7k anyways? This is what I would do instead.\n\n1. Go through Grokking the Coding Interview\n2. Go through Sean Persaud's list \n3. Spend $3.5k on mock interviews focused on DS&amp;A. That's $150 a pop at interviewing.io. So roughly 23 interviews. That is likely more than enough to prepare you on how to approach interviews.\n4. Spend $3.5k on domain specific mentoring/mock sessions from interviewing.io. I don't think you'll need to strictly focus on mock sessions, but a mixture of mentoring and mock sessions would be helpful to know exactly what from your domain is being asked at the top companies. Not sure what it's like for others, but for iOS it's $275 each. So I'd be looking 12 mock/mentoring sessions. Would probably break it up evenly, 6 mocks and 6 mentoring sessions.\n\nThat's obviously still overkill, but that's how I would do it if I was spending the money anyways.\n\n# Where Am I Now\nI've wrapped up DS&amp;A + System Design. Now I'm on the Career Skills portion which touches on negotiation, your interview application strategy, and behavioral skills. Pretty decent so far, but leaves me lots of time to start reviewing my technicals. After this will be the iOS domain portion and then the support period.\n\nBecause I'm on the extended pace, I went a month and a half without touching Leetcode type of problems because I was focused on studying system design for mobile. I recently started getting back into it, but it's nowhere near as difficult as it was when I was first exposed to it. Before I started the program, good luck getting me to even attempt a medium level question on trees. Now I can comfortably attack a medium level tree question and have an idea of how to possibly approach it. Will I get it right 100% of the time? Nope, but I won't sit there like an idiot wasting time. I've solved 5 medium level tree questions today. All within 20-25 minutes from making sure I understand the problem to brainstorming to writing pseudo to writing code. Big improvement from not understanding whether or not I should go with a BFS or DFS approach.\n\nI did a mock interview this past Saturday and I didn't do too well, but got great constructive feedback. It was my first one and I was super nervous, but the next one will hopefully be less nerve wracking. I still need to review other topics such Graphs, Sorting, Recursion (Permutations &amp; Combinations), and even DP.\n\nMy support period will be full of review, my own grind (Mixture of Grokking + Questions from IK), and taking weekly mock interviews on every topic.\n\nI'll be sure to provide an update at the end of my support period. Hopefully with some job offers!",

Reading your prescription of interview.io + grokking is a helpful perspective, but like you, I also desperately need structure in my life when it comes to recruiting. That's why I think signing up for this course is super helpful.\n \nHonestly, the whole company gives me a really shady sales vibe. The webinar they did was obviously pre-recorded, they also reach out to me A LOT via phone. They also gave me an enrollment form which will expire by 4/15, so they're really pressuring me for time which is kind of a bullshit sales tactic IMO. \n I have some questions if you don't mind me asking. **Do you feel like there's some sort of catch to the program beside the pricing?**\n\nI understand IK has a cohort of 15 starting almost every week, which is a lot of people if everyone follows the same schedule. (Thursday, Sunday live sessions, Mon -&gt; Wed self study) etc.\n\nMy main concerns can be summarized as the following two points.\n\n**Would we have to compete for resources with other cohorts?**\n\n* Considering each cohort has a different start date, how is it possible for the Live Technical Class (which happens at the same time for everyone) to be relevant for every single cohort in the early engineering master class? \n* Do they have a different zoom coach for every single cohort for the technical live sessions? How many people are in the zoom meeting for each live lesson, is it the same size as the cohort or are we merged with other cohorts?\n\n**Is there a long wait time for access to resources?**\n\n* What is the average wait time for a mock interview? (1 week? 2 weeks?)\n* What is the average wait time for technical/career coaching? (1 week? 2 weeks?)\n\nI'm a third-year CS student in my final year, I still don't have an internship yet so I wanted to do their early engineering course.",

      "body": "This is going to come off as more of a vent, but I'm trying to explain my situation to get the best feedback I can.\n\nI graduated back in 2021 with a bachelor's degree in a general branch of Computer Information. I have yet to score my first position as an SWE or even in the tech industry in general. I ended up unintentionally taking about 6 months off from the job search hunt due to some personal issues. (I know I'll get tons of comments saying that I'm an idiot for not taking up on the boom of 2020-2021, but I already know that.) Once I felt a bit more motivated and had an understanding of what I wanted to do, I started learning various languages and technologies to help leverage myself.\n\nAfter a while of getting very little responses, and the small amount of interviews I got being failed, I focused on building projects. I posted my resume here, and got a lot of comments from people saying how I'll never make it, and their projects are better cause they could build mine in a few minutes. So I spent more time grinding, trying to Leetcode, and building day in and day out. I would even sometimes dream about coding out my problems. I thought the lack of callbacks, and responses were more towards my resume, but after continuous building, posting, and asking for advice with no real advice being given, I started to get really frustrated and overwhelmed.\n\nTowards the end of last year, I was starting to notice a lack of motivation in building projects. I would still practice leetcode, but it would take me even longer to do anything. I started to receive a bit more callbacks, and  Online Assessments, but then I received pressure from my family to stop looking for these types of jobs and just pick up anything I can (mostly part time), and return to it later. I told them that I was scared to do that because I knew that taking part time work would most likely end up with me having tons and tons of hours, and would not allow for me to have time to look for other work and make projects.\n\nI ended up caving, and ended up with a retail position, where it turned the exact way I thought it would. Even after asking for less hours, they've still gotten me the same amount. Now my family is telling me that I've overstayed my welcome there, and I should look for other work. I've recently realized with earlier applying to jobs again this year, that I most likely caused myself burn out from doing nothing but coding all day every day for months after months on end trying to find a job.\n\nEvery time I try to start a project, or work on my resume, I get overwhelmed and frustrated. Hell, I'm trying to just simply update my LinkedIn and I feel so lost, since I know I won't really receive callbacks.\n\nWhat can I do to make the job hunting game easier on me mentally? I have hobbies now, and exercise pretty frequently. Mentally, I feel healthy and fine, but I can't just get myself back to coding and applying. I have ideas, I've worked on resumes this year, but I start feeling frustrated.\n\nAnyone have any advice on how I can slowly make this better? I've been trying to give myself a bit of a reward system, getting to buy the things I want, or do certain things, if I apply to X jobs in X amount of time, and I did that last year and did pretty well but received very little back.",

Make sure your resume is good, at least enough to pass resume screening, and make sure you continue to practice basic skills (leetcode and language syntax) for OAs and interviews.\n\nIt's okay to de-prioritize doing side projects or passion projects when you're burnt out or out of passion. It sucks that you don't have any full-time experience, but there are ways to fill out a full 1-page resume, even for students before graduation. (It also sucks that you mostly got negative feedback from wherever you posted your resume.)\n\nAs for stress/frustration:\n\nWhat worked for me was not being emotionally invested in any applications unless I received a reply/interview. Literally just apply, log the details (date, company, position), and move on to the next one. Can't fail to meet expectations if I have no expectations in the first place.\n\n(More cynical) Also, it sounds like you have ways to destress, so why not just accept the stress and frustration to make your destressing even nicer?

During the third interview, you meet with the GM (who is almost always one of the most friendly and jovial - as well as professional - people you've ever met) and he will usually tell you he likes to keep his store running very well, etc. You can discuss your pay rate - I would suggest asking for essentially $2/hr. more than you actually think they'll agree to, as starting high makes you seem confident in the value of your time and suggests that you plan to stay with the company, which is what they want. He will ask if you're comfortable selling \"branded payments\" (the Best Buy Credit Card) and will offer you a drug test if they haven't already. Finally, they'll ask you to sign a few pieces of paper (which I strongly recommend reading because I've needed to call them out on a point or two in the past) and will meanwhile subtly suggest that 'if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.' \nOverall, you don't really need any preparation other than dressing to impress, and being prepared to explain why your time is valuable.

Except that if I showed up in BO and unprofessional attire I would’ve been fired by my previous company and I wouldn’t have a track record of being hired.

Just be enthusiastic, have your own type of personality and seem like you have energy for days. ",

AI is free, don't pay for AI services.\n   * beware of scams; job offer without even a phone interview, if they are sending you a check to purchase anything, saying their ats can't read your resume buy this template that works, email from gmail, outlook, not a real web site.\n   * **it will mess with your head.** it feels like you are at fault. other people will say that you are not working hard enough. **nobody will understand how bad this job market is unless they are job hunting themselves.**\n   * love yourself, forgive yourself.\n* **for job boards (ATS):**\n   * indeed/glassdoor, linkedin, and monster is where I had most luck.

I also have an \"old folder\" in each subfolder for when I update documents.\n* occasionally, take out a bullet point irrelevant to the position I am applying for and put one in that is a main requirement of the position that I am applying for. for instance, I will take out some *managing of production* bullet points and put in more *HR related* bullet points if I am applying for an HR position as opposed to a GM position.\n\n**for AI:**\n\n* learn to use AI, let AI write cover letters.\n* use AI for \"message to recruiter,\" \"what makes you best candidate,\" etc. questions.\n* never solely rely on AI, always edit it to more of your own words.\n* **take care of yourself (I neglected myself)**\n   * exercise\n   * shower\n   * eat right\n   * go to church/pray\n   * don't forget about family\n   * give yours eyes a rest\n   * reading glasses make your eyes worse. don't use unless you need and use glasses made for screens/monitors. blue light filter in the evening.

(I am guilty here, but getting better).\n   * stay connected to friends and family\n   * be patient with those who have a job, parents, people who are not going through what we are. as much as I want to wish they lose their jobs and have to learn, no bad karma.\n   * accept some people may not realize how bad things are. good for them if they are that successful or lucky. ignore them.\n   * don't feed the trolls. ignore them (how miserable their lives if that's what they enjoy).\n* **give good karma (what goes around comes around).**\n\n**for interviews:**\n\n* I try to get away from stupid questions like \"tell me about a time you did not get along with\"\n* **I ask \"what are your pain points?\"** I want to talk about their problems and how I can solve their problems.\n* they know about my abilities from my resume. the interview is to see if they like me as a person.\n* the 2 best interviews (I got hired from one) is ones where an admin person, a recruiter, the person who will be my supervisor, or the person running the show calls you for a phone interview, then the second interview was in-person.\n* some places may have multiple interviews and may be legit, but I found that they were not serious about hiring (at least for me).\n\n**for those of you who are being ghosted or apply to hundreds of jobs;**\n\n# here is what is really going on a link to a video by [a recruiter on the 2024 job market](https://www.tiktok.com/@the_realest_recruiter/video/7351874244038577454?_r=1&amp;_t=8muuFwwuZY6)\n\n# UPDATE: I GOT A JOB!!!!!!!\n\nthank you to all those for their support and prayers. for those of you still looking, i will continue to pray for you. do not give up.\n\nthe job is 2 hours away from home, so i will stay with friends during the week. the money is not what i was making when i owned my own company, but this is doing something that i am good at and enjoy. the people that i am working with are sweet as pie.\n\nit is with a municipality (government job). they really wanted me; the gave me $8K over what was posted. **i know that it was not me, my skills, education, or experience. it is the job market!**\n\ndo not blame yourself for not getting a job!",

      "body": "[If anyone has ever worked for Best Buy or has any pertinent knowledge and advice for me going into this interview I would be most appreciative of you if you could share it with me, thanks!]\n\nI managed to land an interview at a local Best Buy in the next few days by going into the store and asking one of the sales people if I could speak with whoever did the hiring. I waited around for a little while and eventually one of the department managers came up to speak with me. I asked him a few questions about how long applications stay on file [I applied earlier in the month] and if the store needed any additional help now. In the course of our conversation I gave him a paper resume of mine and he told me that they were looking to hire about 15 people to work the floor in preparation for the back to school shopping influx that lasts through Christmas. He said that he would give my resume to and tell the HR person in the store to pull my application and that I should hear back at the end of the week. \n\nLow and behold I did get a call from the HR department this past Friday and had a ~15 minute phone interview which I learned that they were looking to add only part time sales staff (max 32h/wk) while they only promote internally for full time positions. \n\nThe kicker is that I have a BA degree in Philosophy and am looking to start working in a position that at least offers a career path/benefits/normal work hours/enough pay for me to be self sufficient. I'm just fine with working PT now so long as I have the potential to be promoted if I am successful at my job. I actually would rather work PT now through the summer weather so I can also continue training hard for triathlons and do my other outdoors 'hobbies' and then move up to full time work during the winter. But how can I let the HR people know this during the interview without coming off wrong and killing my chances of getting the job?\n\nThanks!",

Go in with a positive attitude about the products they sell, and mention how much you like helping people. I wouldn't worry about communicating your career path desires right off the bat unless they ask. Like dempro said enthusiasm will be a great plus for you.\n\nOnce you are hired, try to find a manager that you can get along with. Develop a relationship with them, and when someone leaves or gets fired, be sure to casually inquire about the position. You don't need to do a hard sell. The best thing to do is simply work harder than anyone else. Look to pick up extra hours, look for things that need to be done that aren't and do them without being asked. Make your manager's job easier. Make them look good. If you're interested in supervisory/management positions be sure to NEVER talk bad about anyone in the store. You want to find people that suck and find ways to improve their performance. Always be busy, especially when everyone else is standing around chatting. If there is training available to you above and beyond what's required for your position take it. Learn as much as you can about as many different jobs as you can. If you do that you won't have to tell them you're interested, they'll be way ahead of you and will be happy when your name shows up in a candidate list for a position.\n\nMake sure that the store manager knows your name, and try to find subtle ways to bring your accomplishments to management's attention without bragging.\n\nThere are two things to watch out for. You don't ever want to be so valuable in your current position that they're afraid to promote you out of it. The second is to be careful not to become a threat to your immediate manager. You never want someone to think you're out for their job, even when you are. It's too easy for them to sabotage you, especially in retail.\n\nI went from a summer job making $10/hour in the stock room to $90k/year including bonus basically running a store in about two years with a major international retailer. Keep in mind that I had extensive management experience in a different field, but during my time in retail I helped a kid go from a job unloading trucks at around $8/hour to a salaried manager making almost $40k/year in under a year. Retail is one of the few places where you can write your own ticket. The hours are horrible and you have to be willing to sacrifice basically everything  (put the store first before birthdays, vacations, hobbies) but if you are willing to work hard you can accomplish anything.\n\nTL:DR Go to the interview with a good attitude and you'll get hired. Once you're in the door, work harder than anyone else and look for ways to stand out, they'll get the picture.",

When they find someone willing to work for near minimum wage in a retail store, you're stuck there for years before they'll flag you for something higher up, and even then the fact you've been in store for that long will actually work against you in their eyes.  \n\nWhen you go in for the interview, just be excited about working at Best Buy, that's about all they are looking for.

I'm also a quick learner and I adapt to new environments fast.\n\n\nHow did you learn about the opening?\n\nI was thinking about places I wanted to work and I'm really into tech so I looked online to see if you were hiring.\n\n\nWhy do you want the job?\n [How it helps your goal]?\n\nI want the job because I'm a tech enthusiast and I think it will help me achieve my long term goals by keeping me informed about the latest tech and gadgets. \n\n\nDescribe your dream job:\n\nMy dream job would probably be live streaming video games to people on the internet.

I'm not sure what im doing wrong in the interview as its hard for me to tell or describe what I did. I tried to make my answers relevant to the job, and tried to sound confident. I wasn't nervous, I was fairly calm.\n\nI showered before, wore business casual clothes, I had my hair brushed and had no makeup. My interviewer was in sweater and casual like clothing no suits. I was neatly groomed and was the best I could be. I wore a black blouse and black pants with black boots as it was snowing as well as a puffer jacket.....because as I said IT WAS COLD.

That's a huge achievement in itself, especially for a first job. Sometimes, the hurdle isn't your qualifications or even your demeanor, but how you frame your experiences. With your background leading coding projects, you have a wealth of accomplishments, even if they weren't paid roles. When you talk about those projects, try to focus on the specific challenges you faced, the actions *you* took to address them, and the positive outcomes or impact of your efforts. Even for an Admin Assistant role, your ability to manage tasks, lead teams, and deliver results on a project demonstrates organization, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are exactly what those roles need. Think about specific examples where you overcame a hurdle or initiated a solution in your project work. It's often about connecting the dots for the interviewer between your unique experiences and their job requirements, even if it feels like a stretch, by highlighting those transferable skills. Perhaps getting some mock interview practice with a friend or career coach could help you refine those stories and articulate your value more clearly. It's a tough market right now, but your persistence is truly admirable. You might also find it helpful to explore platforms that help match your unique skills to a wider range of opportunities, including remote positions that could leverage your programming background or project leadership experience in different ways.

Practicing your answers and how you say them out loud with Nora AI or a friend helps you sound confident and smooth. \n* Communicate your experiences clearly-  Even with limited “formal” work history, you do have relevant experience like customer interactions on Fiverr, coding leadership projects Focus on specific examples that show your skills and how you solve problems or work with people  this helps interviewers see your potential. Ask thoughtful questions at the end like what success looks like in the role to show interest and engagement. \n* Leave a great impression- First impressions matter arrive on time, dress appropriately, and use positive body language like eye contact, smile, a firm handshake. After the interview, follow up with a thank‑you email to reiterate your interest and appreciation for their time.

No. As soon as the interviewer doesn’t hear exactly what they want, it’s curtains. “Ok you can go ahead and ask questions, if you want”. 20 minutes into a 45 minute interview that they were 7 minutes late to. I asked how do you keep learning in your day to day. “I don’t. I have 4 kids”. Right, thanks.\n8. Next week, I’ve got another final round. Just got the 4 hour schedule. 3 of the hours will be 1 hour individual case studies in a field I have no experience in. Am I confident I’ll be able to get through the case studies with solid answers? Yes. Do I think the answers will be production grade and comparable to what the HM who’s been working there for 5 years would say? No. Just want to withdraw my candidacy at this point cause I’m so fucking tired of these smug HMs looking right through me and thinking about what they are going to have for lunch when they don’t get exactly what they want to hear.\n\n\n\nDidn’t mention the 10 or so non-final round candidacies I’ve had. I’ve tried to completely let go of my ego. I must be doing something wrong. I must try harder. I've paid for countless of mock interviews. I must learn more and be better. But I’m here to say I’ve spent all my internal willpower and I’m just done. To stay sane I work out. It helps and makes me look better/healthier/happier in interviews. \n\n\n\nDon’t know why I’m posting because realistically all strangers can do is tell me “things will get better, you’re learning every time, it wasn’t the right opportunity anyway, this is a tough market.”\n\n\n\nI run out of money in 8 weeks. I’ve already run the brakes off my vehicle doing 800+ deliveries so that’s off the table. Gonna get a restaurant job but that only buys about two extra months on the mortgage before I start missing payments there.\n\n  \nThe worst part? I don’t think this is going to be the last time I go through this experience in my life. Being a data analyst, business intelligence, whatever the fuck you want to call it, the writing is on the wall: This job is not going to be around in ten years, at least not in the numbers being hired at today.\n\n\n\nSwitching careers just seems like a massive investment I frankly don’t have the money for at this point. Catching me on a day like today, where I’m so down, it feels like my path in life is to try and piece together the scraps of what’s left in my career over the next 8-10 years, with two more layoffs sprinkled in, and then hang on and hope inflation has gone up so much I’ll be able to afford my mortgage with whatever jobs are left for the non-AI adjacent folk. \n\n\n\nThanks kind strangers and let my ego have it, I just desperately want to get back on my feet.\n\n\n\nTLDR- frustrated, rejected from many final rounds, and fairly certain the rug will get pulled out even if I’m able to find my footing at some point. Impostor syndrome has never been higher",

      "title": "Here are some tips for programming job interviews from a dev who was forced to interview tons of people",
      "body": "Hey, I'm a senior developer who has been put on the panel of interviewers for hiring new people for many different teams in the company. To be honest, every time it is time to hire new people, I'm hoping the first few candidates are great so the interview process is over quickly. Here are my tips on how to pass our interviews.\n\nWe look for 2 basic things when interviewing someone:\n\n1. Do they appear to know what they claim to know\n2. Do they have a personality that seems easy to work with (good communication skills)\n\nHere are a list of common issues I have seen in candidates, and how to solve them:\n\n**Problem: When an interviewer asks a question, the candidate may attempt to answer it initially, but then rambles on about other things they have worked on.**\n\n**Solution:** Keep your answers clear, concise, short, on point. I have a list of questions that I use to check your knowledge on various things related to the job position. The more concise your answers are, the more questions I can ask. The more questions I can ask, the more confident I will feel that you have the knowledge required. Generally 1 minute is the maximum amount of time you should ever take to give a response to a question, unless it is a live coding question.\n\nIf I don't feel you have sufficiently answered a question, I will generally follow up and try to lead you to the answer I am looking for to check your knowledge, but if you keep talking on and on and don't give me a chance to get through all my questions, I know a lot less about you, and I can't be confident in recommending you.\n\n**Problem: When an interviewer asks a question, the candidate gives vague answers where it is difficult to discern their experience.**\n\n**Solution:** Talk about your specific experience on the job. Give examples of specific things you have worked on. If you worked on a frontend UI component library, tell me about the last UI component you worked on. What functionality did you add? What part of the process of writing that component did you feel shows off your skills the most? Give specific examples of good things you did, like what technical challenges you encountered while writing that component and how you overcame them?What standards were you following and what are examples of how you implemented these standards into your code? Basically: give very specific examples. Don't leave your answers at \"yeah I wrote HTML and CSS and used these other technologies when I worked on this thing\".\n\n**Problem: When an interviewer asks a question, the candidate tries to fake knowledge of the subject by giving a generalized and vague answer.**\n\n**Solution:** If you don't know the answer, just say so, so the interview can move on. It's perfectly OK to not know everything. Some questions are designed to instantly identify top-level candidates and it's not expected that most people would know the answer. Your best route here is to describe how you would figure out the answer to this question, e.g. what resources you use and your methodology for solving problems you do not already know the answer to. I want to work with someone who can solve problems on their own with minimal guidance, not necessarily an expert in one subject who has difficulty expanding their knowledge.\n\n**Problem: The interviewer can't understand what the candidate is saying.**\n\n**Solution:** Make an attempt to enunciate clearly and buy a decent microphone if you are doing remote interviews. Put the microphone near your mouth. I have run into this problem a lot where candidates have very heavy accents or poor technical setups which lead to my inability to understand what is being said. If I can't understand you, I don't have the ability to figure out what technical experience you have, and there's no way we can hire you. I feel really bad when this happens, but it is what it is. You need to have the ability to communicate with the team you are working with.\n\n**Problem: The candidate does not ask the interviewer any questions when given the chance.**\n\n**Solution:** Ask the interviewer questions that show you have interest in the job. If you ask no questions, it is generally perceived that you don't care. It also gives you the opportunity to weed a bad company out. Easy questions are: How long have each of you been at this company? Why have you stayed at this company so long? What do you like and dislike about your job? What does a day working on your team typically look like? What time does the work day start/stop? (In many tech companies this is flexible.) If an interviewer gets offended by that last question, it is not a good place to work. You want to find somewhere where the workers have a clear delineation between personal and work lives. Any company that tells you 60-80 hour weeks are normal, you should stay away from.\n\n**General tips:**\n\n1. The core of an interview is the interviewer wants to see that you had relevant experience at your past job that translates to your new position. Help the interviewer out. Talk about your experience. Don't say \"I know this\", show that you know it.\n2. How you work with other team members and other teams generally comes up as a topic, so be prepared to discuss challenges with communication &amp; how you solve them.\n3. Your visual presentation on remote interviews matters. Dress up. Learning how to light your face nicely like a youtuber can also help. Better to show an empty wall than a messy room. If you have a nice room, showing it doesn't hurt. Don't be in a place where people are talking in the background. An interviewer may not consciously notice these changes, but they will subconsciously.",

This was an executive level role. \n\nI still didn’t get the role.\n\nIt went to someone internal, who had been there for 20 years, and they have a reputation in the industry for promoting from within.  The COO even called me and said they were trying to create a role, but they couldn’t get full buy in for the cost.  \n\nI was bummed out, but also recognized that there was nothing I could have done differently, outside of going back in time and applying 20 years ago, that would have won me the role.  And it’s happened many times before.  Someone has more experience than you, or they have a relationship / relative you don’t, or they grew up in a certain place, the bottom line is the reason you didn’t get hired was completely out of your control, but you did so well that your skills, experience and accomplishments put yourself in a position to go head to head with someone who has a distinct advantage.  And I promise you, roles you won in the past were because of advantages you had that were out of your control too.\n\nGood luck everyone!\n\n",

Record yourself multiple times answering common retail questions about customer service scenarios, handling difficult situations, and why you want to work for that specific company. Watch those recordings back and be brutally honest about your delivery, body language, and whether you'd want to hire the person you're seeing on screen. Companies like Target and Best Buy are looking for people who can connect with customers, so if you can't connect with a camera, that's a red flag for them.\n\nI actually work on [AI interview tool](http://interviews.chat), which helps people navigate exactly these kinds of challenging interview formats and practice their responses until they feel natural and confident.",

      "body": "So I just want to start this by saying that I researched this subreddit before I decided the apply to the company and I usually do with most companies. But this had to be just about the only subreddit that I hadn’t heard a single good thing come out of anyone’s mouth. I figured to myself that it can’t be that bad and so I decided to give it a chance. Big mistake…\n\nAlso just a side note. I have never lived in a big city or anything with a population over 280,000 people and the city I moved to has a population of about 620,000 if you include smaller surrounding areas. So the job market is someone fierce in my opinion. In the smaller cities I’ve lived in I’ve never not had a company call me back next day or at least day after and tell me they loved my resume and want to schedule an interview. So this was new for me.\n\nI recently moved to a new area with my gf and I obviously needed a new job. I am currently going to school for computer science and so I figured with all my years of customer service and experience working with customers of all kinds that this would be a breeze. I have never worked in sales before but I assumed that as long as you can talk to a customer and keep a positive attitude that it can’t be that hard. \n\nSo I applied online… I have to do a video interview?????? Hello????? How much more degrading does it get than that…. At least they let me keep my clothes on for it I guess. Anyway I figured okay it’s just a video interview because it’s a tech company and that how they weed out the people with no tech knowledge. I still don’t believe this to be the reason but we just will ignore that for now.\n\nNext I received a call from someone in a whole different state (about 600 miles away) telling me that they would like to ask me a few screening questions. No big deal. They then told me I would be receiving a text or call about an interview. I was thinking to myself “This is great pretty easy process”. Boy was I in for one hell of a ride… \n\nI got a call that my interview would be the following day at noon. So naturally I showed up for my interview around 11:45 like a good boy. 👦 I walked in the front door and told the host I had an interview with… we will call him Hank. So the host tells me to go take a seat at geek squad and someone will come out to get me soon. I sat and waited for about 15 minutes so it was about 12:05 and finally this very sweet girl from the geek squad desk asked me if I was there for a repair and I told her I was there for an interview and she told me “Oh good luck you’re gonna live it here, we have lots of fun at this store.”  This gave me this genuine feeling of comfort and made me think that everyone in this sub is just have bunch of whiney babies or y’all just have bad management or something. Well… I apologize for my outburst. ❤️\n\nAnyway I continued waiting for anyone to come out to get me or give me an update on what was happening. I just chopped it up to them being busy and so my interview was delayed but I still have no idea why I had to wait so long. 12:35 rolls around and I still am sitting over in the geek squad center waiting for someone to get me and someone finally comes over to tell me that Hank is on his way out to get me. 12:43 rolls around and Hank finally comes out to get me and so we walk back to participate in the most informal interview I have ever taken part in. For the first 10 minutes of the interview Hank described to me in vivid detail how his favorite game in the entire world (Animal crossing Horizons or something like that) was more than just a game and it taught you really life skills. He told me her got in on the day it dropped and hasn’t missed a single day of play time since day one. So whatever that streak is. I’m not sure what day it came out but if I had to guess it would be multiple years. But I don’t really care about that part, people have hobbies, what I care about is the language he was using. While he was explaining everything to me he used Retarded about 3-4 times and f**k just about the same number of times. Now these words don’t offend me or anything but it was just very unprofessional. Then they told me about 5 minutes after he stopped talking about his game that they didn’t have time to get to any of the important job related questions for the interview that day because he had a meeting to get to and asked me if I could come in the next day around 1 to finish the interview. Mind you I live about 30 minutes from this Best Buy. So all in all I just spent around 2 hours of time with this interview just for one day. \n\nNow… if I hadn’t moved somewhere new and was in dire need of a job I woulda just declined any further action with the company and gone on my way but I didn’t really have that choice because I needed money. I told him that would be fine and I would be there the next evening for the interview. \n\nSo the next day rolls around and I show up for my interview 10 minutes (12:50) early this time. Same thing happens I walk in and the host sends me to geek squad. I then sat there and waited until 1:45 until who I believe to be the shift lead that day came to ask me if I was being taken care of and I told him I had an interview scheduled for 1. And he looks me straight in the face and says “it’s 1:45” and I really didn’t know how to respond to that… so we just stared at each other for a second or two and then he said I’ll get Hank for you right now. So I heard him hop on his walkie and tell Hank to get out there right away. About another 10 minutes passed (around 2:00) and Hank finally comes out to get me. \n\nWe walk back for the interview and he seems very annoyed. We then sat down and he asked me two questions… TWO QUESTIONS!!!! I had to come back the next day and wait over an hour for him to ask me if I think all people should be prosecuted for stealing and if another job offered me a position if I would take it. You gotta be kidding me… I told them yes and no to those two questions. He tells me I passed the test. So now again I have spent around two hours of time on the second interview SO HE COULD ASK ME TWO QUESTIONS!!!!!!! Again if I had anything else lined up I woulda left and cut all ties but after applying to 30+ jobs they were the only ones to get back with me. So then he tells me that I have to have an interview with his boss or something and I told him that was fine and we scheduled that interview. We won’t talk about that one tho because it was rather pleasant and I had to wait maybe 5 minutes after my interview start time for him to come get me. Very polite and genuine guy. \n\nI was then offered the job and scheduled my first day of training. My direct supervisor Hank then gave me his number and told me to text him whenever I needed anything no matter if he was working or not. I told them in my interview I had a vacation week coming up but I guess it wasn’t relayed to the scheduling manager and so they scheduled me during my vacation. I text Hank and let him know that I was scheduled during my vacation time and wanted to know if we could get that fixed. \n\nThree days passed and I didn’t have any scheduled work days coming up and Hank never text me back so I went into the store and talked to someone to let me know I was scheduled but I wouldn’t be there and they told me they would get it fixed right away (They never did and then called me on one of my shifts asking why I hadn’t shown up). There was an employee there that I had followed during my first few days and so I went to say hello and they told me that now since I was off the clock technically that I needed to just leave and abandon ship. They told me 7 people had just quit a few weeks earlier because the management is so bad. They told me that all people care about is if you are selling cards and memberships and protection plans and then you don’t receive a kickback or commission. That is the craziest thing to me. \n\nSo essentially I can work my ass off and be the best in sales in the store and yet I will make the same as someone that is just showing up for a paycheck and not doing their job to the best of their abilities.\n\nAnyway the final straw for me was when I figured out that their employee discount isn’t even much better than most Amazon deals and discounts during sales. So then at that point I just couldn’t see any reason in staying with the company. So here we are weeks after I last text Hank and he still has not responded to any of my texts after my first day. I’m so glad that I left before I wasted any more of my time. If anyone is reading this. And you are thinking about getting a job here. Please go anywhere else save your sanity and your time. ",

It isn’t the CIA, I won’t be making anywhere near $100,000 or have weekends or holidays off, and I’m overqualified for it. It’s a job. And albeit and important one (I mean they are safety professionals), it’s still a job at the end of the day. Delta is a mega corp, who like any other business, exploits their workers. The proof is in how they treat even basic applicants. I just don’t get the hype, if I’m being honest. It’s outdated and not employee-centric.\n\nI definitely had the right attitude going into the day. I was prepared, on-time, positive, present. I answered the questions well! But I also have an invisible disability that although not disqualifying for the position, may lend itself to Delta not liking me. I can be over-expressive when anxious, for instance.\n\nDelta is a “prestige” airline. They don’t want regular folk and it shows. They want you to sell the dream, to be classy, elegant, sophisticated. It’s an unspoken rule. And although I had good posture, spoke well, made eye contact, had slick backed hair, etc I feel they’re too uppidy for someone like me.\n\nAnd their response was “I know you want this job, so you have to go through this again and again until you get lucky.”\n\nI will def not be doing it again. While the job seems dope and a true dream, I don’t feel any corporation or job is worth being put through such a stressful, time-consuming process. They don’t seem to value our time, either and spent the last 40 min blabbing about time sheets and specific details that should only be covered if you actually obtain the job!\n\nI honestly believe if I were offered a job and went on to work for Delta, I’d try to push for making the workplace *actually* more inclusive. To allow folks who don’t come from privilege the same opportunity to apply and advance. People who may not show up in the traditional way we think about in terms of displaying anxiety, etc. (someone who’s nervous for a job interview might know exactly what to do in case of an emergency, for instance—especially when trained).\n\nAlso, we all left at the same time—so no clue if anyone actually made it! I know I’m great and provide value, so I have no doubt I’ll find a job that holds the right cultural fit and pay!\n\nBest of luck to y’all, though! Genuinely rooting for ya! ✈️\n",

They were kind enough  to talk to me. \n\nThey pointed me toward a position they’d just posted that day, and advised me to apply online. \n\n(Side note: To any Boomers, this is 1000% poof that you can’t walk into a place, give a firm handshake, and not leave without a job. \n\nIt hasn’t worked that way in at least 2 decades.

It separates them from the human and makes denying them easier if they don’t have to talk to them in person.)\n\nWell, the in person chat went very well. They seemed to like me.

I thought it would be that day. \n\n1 anxiety filled day later…\n\nI was at a coffee shop listing my things for sale (like, I seriously need this job.

They never cut me off.)  My years of customer service has let me perfect that trait. I was very transparent about who I am, my goals, and that they would get 110% of my abilities. I displayed an eagerness to learn and join the team. I’m getting started in this field. \n\n(You HAVE to start somewhere. Experience doesn’t poof into existence no matter how much employers expect it to.)\n\nI sent a follow up thank you email that I knew they would see on Monday to show my gratitude, that I’m still interested, that I’ll take extra steps, and to keep myself in their minds. \n\nAnd yet, nothing. \n\nI know it’s the day after they said they would contact me, so should I give them more time?

In 2019 I decided to move back to Vegas because well I thought I missed the place after 3 days I was ready to leave but decided to stay put and work. I finally got the courage to pack up in 2021 figured I would buy a home and change careers well with how the housing market is/was everything was just to expensive so I decided to come back in 2023. I had a job interview today and the manager made a comment \"oh it looks like you like to go back and forth\" I responded that I've only ever left twice and that I'm from Vegas. I feel like my moving could be hurting my opportunity to get employment and makes me look shady however I worked the entire time I was gone so I wasn't just hanging out not being productive. I also don't feel like I should feel guilty for trying to do better in life by leaving my hometown. like I said I never left my city for 31 years. what would be the best way to respond to a statement like that?

      "title": "Communication is critical for any interview, here's what are companies looking for",
      "body": "No amount of skills can compensate for terrible communication in an interview.\n\nIf you're looking to brush up on your interview skills, then you should focus on improving your communication. There's no way around it.\n\nWhat do employers really want from you communication-wise?\n\nThis comes from someone who loves going to interviews and interviewing people. Lately, I've been helping the local branch of my company grow from 2 to 66 people with about a 3% hire rate (we're picky) — that's a LOT of interviews.\n\nSo, any employer wants to find 3 things from how you communicate:\n\n1. What motivates you?  \nWhy: In any creative field, intrinsic motivation is far more prominent than extrinsic motivation.\n2. How well can you listen and connect with others?  \nWhy: No great job is done by one single person.\n3. How much can you learn and adapt based on constructive feedback?  \nWhy: Talking to people makes the biggest difference in long-term performance.\n\nI'll go through those briefly and give a few tips along the way.\n\n**What motivates you?**\n\nExtrinsic motivation works to a level — that's why you often hear that \"you can't buy loyalty\". Intrinsic motivation is a completely different beast though. What people can achieve by giving them space, and autonomy, and helping them in a cause is unimaginable.\n\nHere are 3 tips to help show that:\n\n1. Keep it short &amp; sweet. People get way too creative with their backstories in interviews and although it's nice to listen when it's well-made, it's not uncommon for someone to overestimate their storytelling genius. It's easier to be amazing in a 3-minute story compared to a 20-minute Ted talk.\n2. Think and share why did you choose this job. If you don't have any reason besides \"I want $$$\" — think of one. A real one. You'll feel better working that job if you know that and it'll help you get hired.\n3. Find a win-win. Why should the company hire you and why do you want to work for them. Check their website, talk to people, and find a **real** reason.\n\n**How well can you listen and connect?**\n\nIf there was a line for \"who hates a micromanaging boss\", I'd be first there. I hate that.\n\nSo, here's how to avoid the type:\n\nFind a place that values your ability to listen and work with others. If the company values good communication, your odds of finding a good boss are way higher.\n\nAlso, try sharing a bit about your emotional reactions to what happens during the interview — don't get stuck in those 19th-century meat factories that only value time in and not real human beings that communicate and generate meaningful things.\n\n**How much can you learn from feedback?**\n\nFinally, feedback — the best for last. \n\nIf you can adapt during an interview, you win. You adapt by matching the communication style, learning what they want in their questions, and gradually improving your approach to the conversation as the interview goes on.\n\nIf your employer can adapt during an interview, they also win. The employer adapts by listening to you, understanding your needs &amp; wants, and helping you find if those would be met in the company's context.\n\nInterviews are a two-way street so you should look for that win-win scenario.\n\nAdditionally, try checking how much feedback is given around the place by asking feedback-y questions. Anything from \"Did I answer that?\" to the casual \"Does that (answer) work for you?\" would do.\n\n**What if you fail?**\n\nDo you now suck as a human being?\n\nNo.\n\nShould you try presenting yourself better next time?\n\nSure.\n\nBut that's about all that a failed interview tells you. Just think about your state of mind to the state of mind of everyone involved — just this one factor can make or break an interview. There's a lot that you can't control during the process and it, ultimately, is a numbers game — try enough times, learn along the way, and get hired. \n\nDon't get down because of a rejection or two — your perfect employer is out there somewhere. The chosen one. The one ring. The dark side. Wati this became really dark o0 xD\n\nAnyway, if you'd like the full article for a few more tips, it's here — [**Get hired with outstanding communication.
