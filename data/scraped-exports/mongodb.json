      "body": "Like many of you, graduating soon and all of my interview processes have been cancelled and/or frozen for the time being. So, back to scouring through LinkedIn for new grad or junior software engineering positions. I decided to collect some data as I went through the applications to help me formulate my next personal project.\n\n**Here's what I found (in order of most wanted by hiring companies):**\n\n**Most commonly asked** for is knowing at least **ONE** of **Java, JavaScript, Python, C/C++, or C#**. I compared the amount of times these languages were mentioned among each other.\n\n* **JavaScript** **(31.89%)**\n   * Plain JS (32.2%)\n   * React (32.2%)\n   * Node (18.64%)\n   * Angular (15.25%)\n   * Vue (1.69%)\n* **Java** **(23.78%)**\n   * Plain Java (84.1%)\n   * Spring (9.1%)\n   * Kotlin (6.82%)\n* **Python (22.16%)**\n* **C/C++ (16.76%)**\n* **C# (5.41%)**\n\n**Second most commonly** asked for is knowledge of **queries and databases**. Here's how they compare against each other:\n\n* **SQL (81.08%)**\n   * Not specified (66.67%)\n   * MySQL (16.67%)\n   * PostgreSQL (10%)\n   * SQL Server (6.67%)\n* **NoSQL (10.81%)**\n   * Not specified (50%)\n   * MongoDB (50%)\n* **GraphQL (6.82%)**\n\n**Third most commonly** asked for is knowledge of **cloud computing and technologies**:\n\n* **AWS** (53.57%)\n* **Azure** (21.43%)\n* **Not specified** (14.29%)\n* **GCP** (10.71%)\n\n**Fourth most commonly** asked is knowledge of **other languages and frameworks** outside of the most common languages listed above.

That being of using a specific **operating system**:\n\n* Linux/Unix (56.25%)\n* Windows (43.75%)\n   * Typically specified for companies using Azure, SQL Server or .NET/C#\n\n**Seventh most commonly** asked for is knowledge of **Testing, Automation or Build Tools:**\n\n* Maven (25%)\n* Jenkins (25%)\n* Junit (25%)\n* Travis CI (12.5%)\n* Jest (12.5%)\n\n**8th:** Knowledge of **Agile/Scrum**\n\n**9th:** Knowledge of **Microservices**\n\n**10th:** Knowledge of **JSON/XML**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* Remember, these are ordered by the amount of times these technologies are specifically mentioned by 185+ companies in their job applications. Not trying to say any of these tools or technologies are any better than each other, just the data I found while applying.\n* Compared to my internship/job searches last year, the things most emerging are more specific mentions of **Golang, Cloud Services, and Containerization**\n* While I just kept track of specific technologies, many applications just ask for general knowledge of object oriented programming, algorithms/data structures, testing and the software development process without mentioning specific languages, tools or frameworks.\n\nHope this helps some of you in planning some technologies to leverage while planning your personal projects! I'm putting together some diagrams and mock-ups at the moment and plan on incorporating as much as I can.",

      "body": "I’ve been applying for about 2 months and have interviewed with 3 different companies so far, ended up being rejected from all of them. I’ve applied to hundreds of roles and this product engineer role was an easy apply on LinkedIn and I wasn’t really paying attention to the job description or salary. \n\nI got the interview invite and did the initial phone interview and was surprised to learn how much they’d be asking of me for such little pay. They want someone who can work with customers, gather requirements, create and organize docs, manage QA and testing, build and maintain dashboards, the list goes on. They also want someone to be proficient with MongoDB and SQL. \n\nI was willing to hear the recruiter out since I’m currently unemployed with no prospects yet and  was hoping the pay would be negotiable. I thought I could just work there until I find a better paying job. \n\nShe said the pay is not negotiable at all. The role is also part time at 30 hours a week “or less”. I did the math and it would barely be more than what I’m making with unemployment. \n\nBy the way the interview process is 4 stages, the first was the phone screening (it was 35 minutes), 2nd is a 45 minute interview with the hiring manager, 3rd is a technical interview, 4th is an interview with the CEO. \n\nI got moved to the next stage. If you were me, would you continue with this process? Financially, me and my husband would be okay with me not working for a while, but he said it might be good to do the interview for practice. I just think it’s ridiculous to interview me 4 times for a role that pays 20/hr. \n\nFWIW I’m a mid level FE developer with nearly 4 years of experience. ",

      "body": "I had a meeting yesterday for this freelancing opportunity. I was actually really excited about this opportunity because I thought it would be a good way to build my technical skills, specifically in data science. \n\nI’ve also been on the job market for 6 months and was hoping that taking on freelancing work would help mitigate the appearance of an employment gap and demonstrate to prospective employers that people do find my skills worth paying for.\n\nHowever, a few things have left me with a bad taste in my mouth after our last meeting: \n\n1. It seems like he made an inappropriate comment to me. He asked about a poster that was hanging on the wall behind me, and I was trying to be friendly and moved my head so he could see it. He said, “oh, you’re cute.” Now, there’s a chance I misheard or misinterpreted the comment, or that he didn't mean it inappropriately. If it makes any difference, I'm a 20-something woman. I regret not asking him for clarification on the comment in the moment.\n2. It seems that he doesn’t intend to have me working on the data science elements of the project that I was hoping to work on. It seems that he’d rather have me take on a broader leadership role in architecting the overall technical solution.\n3. He told me he couldn't afford my initial proposed rate of $73/hr and we negotiated down to $45/hr. Frankly, I'm not so concerned about making money off the project, but that rate is not reflective of the value of leadership-level work. Even my initial proposed rate of $73/hr was made before I had any idea that he was thinking of having me act as tech lead.\n4. I thought this effort was a small, constrained project he wanted done. But I learned he intends to build this project into a startup. It rubs me the wrong way that it seems like he's trying to find the most dirt cheap ways of building a startup.\n\nI'm just not so sure if I'm at liberty to reject a live offer to do technical work, when I really could use some more experience and more proof of other people's confidence in my skill. The work is remote, so it's not like I have to be around him physically. If I did, the comment he made would be a much more serious issue. Plus, there is a chance I misheard. He may not ever make an innappropriate comment going forward, and if he does, I'm now prepared to call it out. \n\nMy bigger concern is whether the project will even give me the chance to build those lower-level technical skills I desperately want to build up. My only work experience is 3 years at this small (now failed) AI startup where myself and my teammates were literally making it all up as we went. Most of my work was in Jupyter Notebooks and very little of it was focused on bringing projects into production. To top it off, I was primarily working with the company's proprietary symbolic AI framework, which gave me little opportunity to build up traditional data science skills, such as performing statistical modeling. I feel like I'm at a point where I'm having a hard time proving to employers that I can do the work they need: \n\n1. No work experience with cloud computing technologies like AWS or Azure\n2. No work experience with SQL\n3. No work experience with databases like MySQL, Postgres, and Cassandra and only minor experience with MongoDB at my old job\n4. Minimal work experience with the application of statistical methods \n\nI'm building the above skills with personal projects, but work experience is much more compelling. \n\nI was hoping this project could be an opportunity to build up \"real-world\" experience with those skills, and an opportunity for me to show potential employers that others have paid me for those skills.  \n\nI'm thinking of just trying it out. I'm not married to the offer-- I can give it a try and leave if it's not giving me what I need or taking away from other, more productive upskilling and job-searching efforts. \n\nWhat would you recommend I do?\n\n**Update:** Decided to take on the project. I received clarification on the project and am interested in proceeding. Obviously, still applying and interviewing for full time work. But the clarification I received shows that taking on the project will help me build necessary skills and it seems worthwhile despite my concerns.",

It is a tough job market, especially for people early in their career, which you are (PRO)\n2.

(as well as encouraging us to look elsewhere) They are not necessary for graduating but a position is always going to be a good option. These recent years have been very difficult for students so I'm wondering what I can do to stand out, specifically for getting that first role. I've read through most of the FAQs and pinned posts here so I'd imagine this is an allowed post.\n\nIn terms of what sort of position I'm looking for, I'm honestly not too sure, but I am really open to anything and really just want to learn more about working with software and what it is like collaborating in a team environment. I'd appreciate any advice for any part of the process: resume building, job search, interviewing, etc.\n\nI've tried to include the most important things at the beginning and least at the bottom. On my resume I've mentioned:\n\n1. Languages I'm relatively familiar with: C/C++, JavaScript, Python, SQL\n2. Technical tools I'm relatively familiar with: Git, RESTful APIs, MongoDB\n3. Project #1: an interactive fiction game I am currently working on using Godot. I developed a text-parser that interprets user commands and processes them, in addition to custom game syntax inspired by retro-style text games of old. I've also mentioned that it has taught me about the whole software development life cycle, especially the planning portions.\n4. Project #2: A full stack web application that searches and catalogues pieces from the Met (in NYC). I've emphasized use of Node.js, RESTful APIs, MongoDB, and React\n5. My education, I study at a relatively small and unprestigious college but my cumulative GPA is a 3.8 which I'm not sure if I should include. Fairly average, I'd think, but I am mentioning my relevant coursework: Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, Database Systems, Web Programming, and Software Testing\n6. Lastly, my past experiences are not really relevant but I have quickly mentioned them on my resume and tried to tie in how I provided value to the workplace. I was a cook for a while and was successful at learning quickly. I also worked at a bank in a customer facing role and mentioned that I was mentioned specifically in many client surveys.\n\nI think my conversational abilities and interview still are reasonably good but I'm also looking for anything else I can do to be more memorable as a potential candidate. My hard programming abilities and skills are still at sort of a beginner/intermediate level, I'd imagine its where I am lacking the most, but I'm working on it.\n\nThanks a lot, would love to hear from you all.

      "body": "I recently started a new job that was advised as a Full-stack Software Developer after being at my first job as a Junior Software Developer for 8 months. I had to leave my former place after I felt stuck not taking on greater responsibilities, poor coding principles, and practices that did not get code reviewed, pay, and mismanagement of projects. However, at least here I was doing programming, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, CSS, and HTML.\n\nAfter job hunting I accepted this new offer which I only started a week ago, after interviewing at multiple places—advertised as a Full-stack Software Developer, requiring to know JavaScript, Angular, HTML, CSS, and C#. With the ability for me to learn new skills such as MongoDB, database querying and creation, proper source control using BitBucket and GIT, using Sprints, code reviewing both giving and receiving, cloud technologies such as Azure, and a proper agile development environment. And of course a better pay. Among others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, here, my job title has now changed to Onboarding Developer, which was not mentioned to me beforehand and was told to me on my first day. In the contract agreement, and from the recruiter, it was stated my title would be Fullstack Software Developer and that my responsibilities would be as mentioned during my interview stages. However, now I am seeing that all I am going to do is use MongoDB to import customer data from whatever format they have into our software/application. \n\nOf course, this has annoyed me and instead of wasting my time here, I am already thinking of starting to look for another job and this time ensuring that it is within the development and that I will be doing programming. \n\nHowever, how bad is it going to look after leaving my first job after 8 months and then looking for another job when being in my current place of work for just a week? Or is this something that I can overcome but truly mentioning I left my first job due to wanting to progress my development skills and responsibilities and leaving my current job due to what appears to be my job responsibilities not matching what was advertised to me?\n\nThanks for any advice. :)",

      "body": "For context I'm a front end dev with like 2.5 years of experience, laid off in December 2023. ☠️ I'm in Canada and got a Bachelors of IT degree in Game Development. ☠️☠️☠️\n\n\nI'm not much of a networker but I tried at least reaching out to my small network of devs I worked with on LinkedIn, or even sent random InMail to recruiters that make LinkedIn job postings. I've asked senior devs and people from r/engineeringresumes for resume feedback. I've also been trying out Angular and Vue mostly out of curiosity to see how they compare to React and to show that I'm acquainted with them. Either way all that stuff isn't really doing much. The majority of my previous work experience is in React, React Native, and Next.js. During my search this whole time I've had two interviews and they both were for full stack roles. Not a single front end one yet.\n\n\nI know the market isn't very pivot friendly right now but I don't know what else to do other than learn more back end stuff. The post title says *\"pivot\"* because I already learned a decent bit of Flask, Django, Express, SQL, and MongoDB before I landed my first two developer jobs. Out of all those I would say I've used Express the most. Before landing anything I made a site in the MERN stack for someone in about two months so I put that on a resume as freelance work. Also at my first dev job (which lasted a year) it was 90% front end related work, but I initially did a tiny bit of back end work here and there in Flask and PostreSQL. I have a specific resume tailored for full stack roles, but ultimately what I've just mentioned is all I can put on it in terms of what I've done at the back end.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, the point of the post is while I'm draining myself sending applications in this crap market, what in the back end would make the most sense to prioritize learning to pass the time?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Spring / Spring Boot: Don't know anything about it but I did use Java in Android Studio and JavaFX for two computer science courses I was able to take in university.\n\n* PHP: I started learning this and Laravel right before landing my first job, then I kinda ditched learning it. I noticed for many web agencies out there it gets paired with Word Press which I've also barely touched.\n\n* .NET:  I've made some games in Unity years ago so I somewhat know C#.  ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n* Ruby On Rails:  Nada. Never touched Ruby.  \n\n* Golang: I was asked if I knew this in an interview. I've never used it though I guess I've used C++ quite a lot when initially learning to program, and Go uses similar syntax to C apparently.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ntldr: Even if the market's bad and the chance to get something out of it is low, is there any particular language / backend framework out there that makes more sense to learn? I haven't really noticed if there's more job postings out there for one over the other.",

      "body": "I just attended my school's resume and interview workshops that gave me information about what to expect. Time and time again, the presenter talked about personal projects. The only project I have ever attempted to build by myself is a website. I also built a tiny quiz using JavaScript. But I'm always afraid that I don't have enough knowledge to impress the employers. At school, all they've taught so far are the basics of OOP, data structures such as lists, graphs and trees and the standard sorting algorithms. But while these are implemented using any programming language, they talk about learning the latest technology that companies use so that you can stand out. The issue is, every company uses different \"technologies\" and since I'm applying for the first time, I cannot rely on a single application to get me my first COOP. I'll have to apply for multiple and if they all use different tech, then how am I supposed to learn all of them if I have to submit like 100 applications to land a potential hire?\n\n  \nI look at some of the job descriptions and some ask people to know stuff like [ASP.net](http://ASP.net), MongoDB or Wordpress, but these are just databases and scripting. I can't find any of the trending technologies out there. And no, I can't be expected to know AI as I'm not close to being introduce to that subject yet which will be in third year.

If you apply for a junior position after 5y of experience, that sends a red flag signal to interviewers (although, it’s not impossible to get the job). I would encourage you to emphasise your experience during the behaviour part of the interview; demonstrate how you solved difficult situations at your current company.\n\nFor the technical part, focus on leet code style questions, refactoring and testing. Interviewers would rarely ask you questions about different frameworks like Spring, React etc. The interview is design to demonstrate your ability to learn things, rather than test your knowledge of Maven. \n\nAnother thing that you could do is to improve your existing job. If you see a lack of quality in the code that your team delivers, you can take ownership of that. You don’t have to enforce good practices, but you can start to slowly introduce them.

I do, some distributed computing work every now and then using Kafka for message communication. Most of the work I do is in Python. There are teams that I can switch to, that do some bleeding edge work. There are teams that do very deep financial modeling, hardcore C++ development and all.\n\nSalary wise, I get paid around 150k a year(Base + Bonus). Maybe, I will plateau around 200k if I become a team lead. But it is far from the 300k salaries that people at Google/Facebook get paid.\n\nThe problem with Bloomberg is that everything they use is proprietary. They are slowly moving away from it. But they are still far away from using any of the absolutely modern technologies that everyone uses. For databases, they have an in-house built database. For the frontend, they have their own proprietary technology that doesn't need HTML, CSS. It is developed in JS none the less but, their own framework of JS that feels nothing like Angular or React. They build their services using their own thing again. All in all, I have to learn *their* ways of doing things to get things done. None of the skills I learn are transferable. But then again.. Flask may faze out.. Angular may faze out.. MongoDB may faze out and people who use these technologies could find themselves in a situation where their skills are irrelevant and they have to learn everything from scratch too.\n\nNow my question is, should I start grinding leat code again and give Microsoft/Google/Facebook a shot? Even if I get into those companies.. I am confident that in this lifetime I won't be working on Google's self-driving car or Facebook's AI projects. Most likely I would be doing some CRUD development work and potentially get paid more than what I currently get paid. Should I instead try to get to a better team within Bloomberg itself?\n\nAlso, how likely is that I can get hired by Zane Street or 2Sigma given the fact that I am already working on finance related stuff and my previous internship was at a famous bank's investment division? Also, is it worth the effort preparing for interviews again for Zane street/2Sigma or any Silicon Valley startup? What exactly am I missing out by staying with Bloomberg?

Most companies will only focus on skills that are relevant for what they are looking for, so you need to consider what type of jobs you are targeting.",

I have read pretty much every past post on Reddit mentioning these three companies and everything on Glassdoor but I have been having trouble comparing them. I have not interned at a major tech company before. The compensation is relatively similar at all of these. All these companies look really cool and interesting to work at and that's why I'm having so much trouble deciding. There are three things I'm really considering right now:\n\n*NYC vs. SF* \\-- I intend to end up in NYC after graduation (from NY and most of my family is here) but I would be willing to try SF for a summer. MongoDB and Bloomberg are NYC, Airbnb is SF.\n\n*Prestige* \\-- I know Airbnb is top on the west coast but I am unsure if MongoDB and Bloomberg are comparable in NYC. Ideally I want to have a strong name on my resume in the case that I don't go back and apply for jobs again the following year.\n\n*My interests* \\-- I am very interested in distributed systems, distributed storage, and cloud. MongoDB seems to align with this pretty well. How do the others align?\n\nI would appreciate if past interns at any these companies would comment on their experience and their thoughts, and what they chose if they were in a similar situation/why they made that choice. Also, if people from industry see this post and have thoughts on prestige, I would certainly appreciate the comments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first post here and I read the rules but sorry if I did not follow something.",

Bloomberg sells access to all sorts of data and all sorts of tools to access that data (it's pretty much one of the first successful SaaS companies). AirBnB is different altogether; I'd assume their main money-maker being their marketplace of rentals/hotels and customers. There's a world of difference between the three, and these points drive all decisions, technical or otherwise. None of them are bad companies at all, but you might imagine how their individual markets and key differentiating factors influence their tech stacks and ways of thinking.\n\nSince it's only three months, I'm not sure if location matters, both are great cities with a million things to do. You could always apply for NYC companies later, if you're confident about your chances. If not, and you need to be fairly certain that you end up in NY, go for Bloomberg.\n\nThere's a lot of distributed systems work going on at Bloomberg with many dedicated teams for building data infrastructure, platforms, services and tools. Application teams usually also have a distributed architecture. However, building on my first point, a lot of this architecture is specialized for BB data (I assume AirBnB's case would be similar), while I'd assume MongoDB wanting to be as generic as possible.\n\nPersonally I have a lot of fun at BB, and the company does have a strong prestige factor (especially in the east coast) and salary. Being at the intersection of tech, finance and news is very empowering, and I get to learn a lot outside of tech as well (the diversity of expertise within the company is insanely good).

          "body": "Quick thought from my last loop: they cared more about how I structured work than buzzwords. I kept a short STAR story bank for bugs I fixed, an API I shipped, and one CI failure I diagnosed. I practiced mocks using Beyz coding assistant with questions from interviewquestionbank. com in 45 minute blocks. If you can demo a minimal Airflow DAG that hits a Postgres table and logs success, that shows real familiarity. Good luck, you’re close.",

          "body": "Honestly, that is a very vague job advert that looks like it just mentions their whole stack rather than what the job needs.\n\nIf I were hiring a junior for that, I’d be looking for a python dev that isn’t going to screw up my repos, so I’d be looking for evidence that you can structure maintainable code with classes, modules, good variable names, DRY etc. I might ask you one soft question about Djangos ORM, a question to see if you use git, and to see if you know what airflow is- I wouldn’t care if you’ve used it.\n\nReact I would just want to know if you have any interest in front end unless it’s a full stack role then I might ask what you’ve done in it before.\n\nThe Microsoft tools is a weird one that I bet was added by HR",
