      "body": "I had an interview today at a fin-tech company (CapGemini). I was doing rather well, making it to the 3rd round where I was interviewed by the VP and another developer.\n\nThe interview went well, they asked me to do basic algorithms on a black board. The kicker was at the end: they asked me if they gave me an offer right now, would I accept? I know the answer should have been “yes I would heavily consider it” or something along the lines, but I said I would want to discuss the position, relocation (the job is 2 hours away), as well as salary. I did tell them that location was my biggest factor, and both sites are my two ideal spots to land. However, I think I shot myself n the foot by playing “hard to get”. The company presumably hires everyone on the same day, and I haven’t gotten an email or a call back after the interview.\n\nDid I blow my chances? Am I overthinking this? Does anyone at CapGemini have experiences with this?",

A day after the initial reschedule, I get another call saying they need to reschedule interview again, because I was booked with the same sick/pregnant individual.

No answer. I do it again a few days again, no answer. I finally get a hold of another HR individual, and they tell me the position is put on hold. Okay this is normal, sure.

I then reach out to a recruiter on LinkedIn and see if they can help. They said they’ll look into it and they’ll have an answer for me in a couple of days. I never hear back\n\nSeriously, Capgemini.

I climbed the ladder, build a reputation as one of the top in the world for that company. \n\nAdditionally, I spearheaded advances in the company.\n\nFor instance, you state that they don't follow best practices. I view this as an opportunity, you could be the one who helps them develop best practices. Virtually anything you see wrong at a company is something you could potentially be the one who is credited with fixing.\n\nMany people do not look at it that way. I see problems and negatives as opportunities.\n\nIf you can do the things that other people avoid, you become highly valuable.\n\nThink of a CEO. A CEO is often hired to turn a failing company around. And why are they the CEO? Because one of the most challenging things anybody can do is solve a problem.\n\nI think at least a few years at a major company will give you the skillset you won't find at a smaller company.\n\nGranted, if you're trying to get into FAANG, well, those are pretty much the top companies at least visibly.",

Almost as bad as calling Comcast. Everything is done through online \"portals\", which isn't uncommon, but man I just felt like I was a single ant inside a multi-million supercolony.

That would have been a huge pay cut so I noped out. \n\nThat's the bad, but really nobody bothered me, I worked with the client exclusively. My CG \"manager\" (really just another dev) worked in another building and i only interacted with him every few weeks. My paychecks cashed on time, and the job was pretty chill (in fact, too chill: I once went a solid month, maybe 6 weeks, doing nothing but reading hacker news all day). So depending on your needs, CG could be an OK company. Especially because they give you the opportunity to travel, internationally even. So that's a perk for some.

Sometimes they'll call it a \"cashier's check\", a \"certified check\", or a \"verified check\".\n\n&gt;You deposit the check into your bank account, and within a couple of days your bank makes some or all of the funds available to you. This makes you think that the check is real and the funds have cleared. However, the money appearing in your account is not the same as the check actually clearing. The bank must make the funds available to you before they have cleared the check because that is the law.\n\n&gt;For various and often complicated reasons, depending on the specific story line of the scam, the scammer will ask you to send someone some of the money, using services like MoneyGram, Western Union, and Walmart-2-Walmart. Sometimes the scammer will ask for you to purchase gift cards (iTunes, Amazon, Steam, etc) and give them the codes to redeem the gift cards. Some scammers may also give you instructions on how to buy and send them bitcoins.\n\n&gt;Within a couple of weeks, though it can take as long as a month, your bank will realize that the check you deposited was fake, and your bank will remove the funds that you deposited into your account and charge you a bounced check fee. If you withdrew any of the money from the fake check, that money will be gone and you will owe that money to the bank.

      "body": "I am a college senior majoring in Information Systems (a less rigorous CS major), and I have been looking for jobs in Project Management or IT Consulting for more than four months now. After 300+ applications, I finally got an offer from Capgemini as a Tech Consultant in the US. However, they don’t know that I will need visa sponsorships in the future.\n\nWhen I filled out the application, I wrote that I didn’t need visa sponsorship because my plan is to use up 36 months of OPT (I am eligible for STEM Extension), save up some money, and then go for grad school. When I went through the interview process, no one brought up the visa sponsorship issue. Now that I got an offer, I want to clarify the issue with them, but I am afraid of the risk that they will rescind the offer since they specifically wrote in the Job Description that they don’t do sponsorships for entry-level positions.\n\nI am talking to a corporate recruiter from Capgemini, and I don’t feel like she will understand my situation because she is new to the job, and she would probably follow the corporate guidelines to make her job easier.\n\nShould I just keep silent and get the offer? Or should I try to explain to them? I don’t want to start a relationship with an employer on a lie/informational conceal, but I will be very disappointed if they rescind the offer just because I am an international student.\n\nReally appreciate the advice from Reddit :)",

I really want the job at Capgemini since I've heard so many good things about them but I have not heard from them in over 3 weeks!! I kinda don't want the job at VMware since the sales teams in Ireland have a bad rep, it's for three years, but they do teach some skills that are extremely hard to come by otherwise: CRM and Salesforce mostly. \n\nWhat should I do??

I don't have work experience regarding this. I'm going to see how it turns out, but I'm still kind of uneasy about this whole interview process. They said the pay was $25/hr for data entry/administrative assistant. It's a work-from-home gig. The pay seemed too good to be true.\n\nThey also asked me to download Google Hangouts, which I downloaded and contacted someone I was told to contact through text. I responded in a text interview through messaging. And then when it was done, they said they would send the interview to HR. I have to message them at 8 am EST (5 am my time) and that I had to be punctual. I was to message them and inquire if I have been hired or not. \n\nIs this hiring process normal or does it set off any red flags for anyone else? I don't want to have to send them my personal information if it seems like it's not legit. What should I look out for? I'd really appreciate the input.\n\n**[edit]**: I posted this question on r/scams and they all said it was definitely a scam. I didn't follow up with the scammer. They did try to follow up with me about once or a few times an hour in the morning. The way they talked definitely was not professional such as sending \"???\" I'm glad I trusted my gut and asked around as well. Also the person's name was supposedly \"Suzette Vanette\" and I looked the name up and it doesn't show up anywhere - no Linkedin or anything. They also claimed to be from \"Capgemini\" which seems to be a legit company but I don't think they are affiliated at all.
