      "body": "Hi all,\n\nAnyone have recent experience with job offers from MC?\n\nAfter a couple rounds of interviews for a Software Engineer  II I got a phonecall from the recruiter. I wasn't actually expecting anything great because a couple weeks ago I was told that they still wanted to interview other candidates, but surprisingly the recruiter started giving me information about the job including what my exact salary would be, the bonus, etc. All details that were not concrete at this point.\n\nI was a little confused so I asked \"Is this you firmly giving me a job offer\" and the reply was \"Here at MC we don't give job offers, this is a calibration.\"\n\nStill confused, I tried to get more information and said I was interested and said I wanted to discuss with my wife. The recruiter said that is okay, but let me know in a few hours. I asked for the weekend to think it over and said I would get back Monday. This seemed okay but said she would need the answer soon because of other candidates.\n\nTruthfully I have another final round that I am hoping to hear good news back from next week, but wanted to know if anyone had ever heard something similar about them not calling the job offer an actual job offer?",

      "body": "Hello everyone, I really appreciate the help I have gotten from this sub in the past and I'm sure that will continue with this post. \n\nI graduated in June of 2023 with a bachelors of science in computer science from Western Governors Univiersity (WGU). It took me 3 years to get through the program as I have a family to provide for and previous student loans, making the prospect of going to a brick and mortar close to impossible. I wish I would have been able to do an internship, but finanicial responsibilities would have made this extremely difficult as well. I began my job search in the spring of 2023 and have had no luck with securing employment as a software engineer/developer. \n\nEver since I graduated, I have been continuing my studies during my free time after work (currently employed as a help desk tech). This involves working on projects, studying for interviews (LeetCode, flash cards, applying to jobs, etc.), advancing my understanding of other languages and frameworks, and networking via LinkedIn. I feel pretty well versed in the Java-Spring Boot ecosystem and have created several full-stack applications utilizing ORM and a functional web interface. All of the projects in my makeshift portfolio are hosted via AWS and available via custom URLs. My focus on Java and Spring is targeted due to these being common technologies requested within job listings posted by companies within my area. In an effort to make myself more marketable, I am currently focusing on developing my JavaScript and React skills. I also want to note that I make a conscious effort to to never rely on tutorials when constructing my applications. I have always strived to begin with the end in mind and build (to the best of my ability) the best practices from the start. \n\nIn regards to my job hunt, I do keep an excel sheet with all of my application submissions and statuses. Since my first application, I have amassed a little over 2,500 submissions. Out of these, I have had 4 final round interviews with a local Mastercard branch that have all ended in rejection. When I ask for feedback from the internal recruiter I am working with, they tell me that the feedback they recieved was nothing but positive and I should continue applying. \n\nI feel like I am making the most of the time that I have at my disposal, but that there is something that I could be doing better. Yes, the economy has been better but entry level candidates are getting job offers and I can't rely on the economy as an excuse. **I feel like I am failing my family and extended family by not getting into a \"real job\" fast enough.** If anyone has any advice on what I could be doing to absolutely maximize my chances I would really appreciate it. Is there a specific tech stack that I could be focusing on to impress potential employers and what projects could I construct to learn/demonstrate them? \n\nTLDR; I believe I am doing all that I can to get a software engineer job out of college but perhaps there is something I can improve on. Do you have any advice on this matter? What technologies can I learn to improve my chances?",

I graduated into covid and was unemployed for 9 months before getting a job, so I know a little bit about what you're feeling.\n\nNext, I'd say you should pay attention to things like layoffs, macro economic news, and anecdotal stuff from other SWE's on reddit.  It's fucking rough out there, so I wouldn't go too hard on yourself.  There are plenty of solid candidates that aren't getting offers.\n\nNow some tactical stuff.  What was your GPA?  Can you post an anonymized version of your resume?  Java/sprint is *kinda* dated tech, at least in that it's not what organizations that are forward thinking are using, BUT there are plenty of shops out there still using it, so I wouldn't think that's bad.  Not to mention, new grad engineers are expected to pick up skills on the job.  Practicing with React and Node/Express would be a good use of time I would say.  Also look into new tech that you find exciting: Next.js, Remix, TailwindCSS, Zustand, this stuff is all new and it might be intimidating, but the point shouldn't be to master it in 2 weeks, it's to see that new tech is exciting and cool and staying excited about the tech is important.\n\nFinally, if you're not doing this already I would log each of your interviews (phone screens, tech screens, and behaviorals) as best you can so you can understand what you messed up on.  Some times nerves will cloud your judgement and you'll mess up a tech screen because of that.  Maybe you'll freeze in a behavioral interview because you haven't prepped an answer for a given question.  IME recruiters don't know jack about what's really going on in an interview and engineers don't have an incentive to give good actionable feedback to the candidate.  Sometimes you will get that and it's super helpful, but being able to discern what you're doing poorly (and doing well!) will be an important skill now and in the future.",

      "body": "So, I just went through a full stretch of interviews for a Software Engineer I position at my local Mastercard branch. The interview process lasted 7 weeks and finished with a 3 hour interview between two lead engineers and a VP. I felt like the interview went amazing and multiple times the interviewers referenced how I was exactly what they were looking for and that they couldn't wait to work with me. To give some background, I am a recent computer science graduate with several personal projects under my belt; just trying to get my first job in the world of software engineering. As you can imagine, I was over the moon at how things appeared to be going.   \n\n\nAfter a week of waiting to hear back the results I sent a follow up email and recieved a reply from the recruiter almost immediately. The recruiter stated that the position didn't get approved in the end of year requisitions process, however he would be taking my interview notes and profile over to the hiring managers of the currently open Software Engineer II positions (as the position I interviewed for was the only I position). He also said that I would be put on a silver medalist list so they could use my interview performance for consideration of other roles. I pretty much immediately felt like I had been taken for a ride and that this was the end of the road, but I sent a warm email back thanking the recruiter for their kindness and so forth.   \n\n\nTo my surprise, not even an hour later the recruiter emailed me again stating that one of the hiring managers for a Software Engineer II position was interested in my profile and wanted to schedule a quick conversation with me. I looked over the position and it appears to use a lot of the technologies that I am familiar with (have had some project and school experience with). The recruiter mentioned that I would not have to repeat the process I just went through and that the interview for this position would just be a 1 hour conversation between me and the hiring manager. I feel pretty good about this, however it feels kind of strange interviewing for a level II position as a new grad. Common sense tells me that the hiring manager wouldn't waste their time and they have all of my interview and application information so perhaps I am just overthinking the whole situation.   \n\n\nDoes anyone feel like they may have experience with/have a pulse as to what is going on here? Do I really have a shot at this position?   \n\n\nTLDR; The Mastercard Software Engineer I position I interviewed for did not get approved in requisitions so the recruiter referred me for a Software Engineer II position and I now have what appears to be a fast-track interview with that hiring manager. Do I have a shot at it and what do you think is happening behind the scenes? ",

I was in backend for a year and was bored and uninterested in backend so moved to frontend (got promoted as well to SWE II).  I thought I'd love it since I'm creative and a visual person. I love seeing the code come to life in a more user-friendly way. I love researching different designs and being inspired by them. However, I feel the majority of my day is adding bandaids to legacy code and fixing edge cases that customers complained about. Or figuring out why the pipelines failed again. It's repetitive. I want a career that I'm energized by and I think I have the potential for that.\n\nI am considering being a PM since I want is a more people/customer-facing job where I can make an impact. A job that is perhaps less-technical work, as well as more high-level work as opposed to very granular stuff. Communication and giving presentations are my strong suit. Although I think realistically the job is heavy on politics and every day is engulfed by meetings which sound exhausting. I considered being a Product Designer but I think that job is granular as well (lots of tweaking designs after speaking with engineers) and I wouldn't feel great about the pay cut either.\n\nI am wondering now since I want a high pay (six figures easily), good work-life balance, a social aspect in my job, creativity, and some alone time, maybe software engineering is the place to be? But just at a different company? But I feel like a software job everywhere is the same. I interviewed at 'Carrot Fertility' recently. I love their mission but when I asked what my day job would be, it was to just work on the forms which companies use to onboard. That didn't sound exciting. I feel like as a SWE, you are pretty removed from the mission of the company. I want a job that fuels me and a company I feel proud to be part of. I'm lost on what my next move (stay in SWE or look into being a PM) should be and am hoping someone would be able to guide me.\n\nAbsolutely welcome any suggestions! Thanks in advance!",

      "body": "**Context:**\n\nI am a CS major at a US top 20 school overall, and around top 40 CS. I realize the advantage of this, so take my story with a grain of salt. This post focuses on how I went from not being able to reverse a linked list to getting 4 six-figure plus offers (1 at a BigN, 1 at a unicorn, 1 at a prop shop, and 1 company in SF). Hope you all are ready for my 2 year journey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sophomore Year:**\n\nI go to my first career fair in the Fall and give some companies my elevator pitch. I have a solid GPA, have a few class and hackathon projects listed on my resume, and am a TA for Intro CS. I get a few interviews at non-tech companies like AT&amp;T and MasterCard. I get pretty far with AT&amp;T after passing fizzbuzz and reverse a string, but I failed the last question cause I couldn't reverse a linked list on the spot. I fail MasterCard behavioral because I didn't know the STAR method. In the Spring, I somehow manage to convince the CEO of a tiny startup to allow me to help code some plug-ins his wordpress website at out startup career fair because I learned PHP in one of my web development classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Junior Year:**\n\nAll right, last year's recruiting cycle didn't go that well. I had to change my strategy, so I started reading posts on this sub and hear about the magical website called leetcode which apparently is the key to getting those highly coveted silicon valley internships. I do \\~40 leetcode problems that were mainly easy difficulty so that I don't mess up questions like reverse a linked list. **Even though I did those problems, I didn't feel like I learned any common patterns among the questions and had to look up the answer often**. I decided to TA DS&amp;A to keep the info fresh as well. I manage to get an onsite at a BigN because of campus recruiting but ultimately fail all the problems. **I knew that I needed to use BFS/DFS or merge sort to solve the questions they gave me, but I couldn't code them on the whiteboard because I had never practiced mock interviews.** I fail another BigN online assessment I got through a referral because I freeze up on LC medium tree and array questions. I felt stupid because one of my friends got the BigN without ever doing a leetcode. I did get a few other interviews at non-tech companies, and I got a job at a healthcare tech company because they didn't ask any leetcode style questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Junior Year Summer:**\n\nLast year went better, but it still wasn't exactly what I wanted. I decided I would double down on leetcode after work over the summer and I would try my best to practice effectively. **I tried learning as much as possible during work about how to work in a team, learning from code reviews, asking my mentor and senior engineers tons of questions, learning how this company structures their code to be maintainable, efficient, and modular**. Most importantly, I tried to learn how these engineers made their decisions. What was their thought process? **I knew everything I learned during work was a talking point for behavioral questions for my next round of interviews, so I made the most of it**.\n\nAfter work, I'd hit the gym, get dinner, and work from 7pm-10pm fully caffeinated and brushed up on common algorithms and **doing leetcode** ***by category***. I learned tree traversals, graph traversals, merge sort, recursion, two pointers, sliding window, greedy, etc. I learned each algorithm's time and space complexity. I realized I didn't really understand recursion until this summer, and I am just amazed at how useful it is for a ton of these problems. Once I actually learned the concepts behind the categories, doing these leetcode questions became much more enjoyable and I was cranking them out quicker. **I framed my learning based on** [**Jeremy Aguilon's article**](https://jeremyaguilon.me/blog/ranking_interview_questions_by_cram_score)**. Thanks so much Jeremy!** Jeremy is soooo right about how 80% of leetcodes can be done by knowing several strategies and 20% are the annoying \"gotcha\" questions everyone hates. All the leetcode questions I got in my real technical interviews senior year fell into the 80% category, and it's crazy how doing them in 30-45 minutes becomes more and more realistic once you figure out the patterns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Side note about working after work and if the leetcode grind is worth it:**\n\nI worked around 7pm-10pm Monday-Thursday, took Friday off, and 11am-4pm on Saturday and Sunday. This wasn't a super strict schedule, though. I still had a ton of fun over the summer on my nights off turning 21 and hanging out with friends. I was bored 7pm-10pm Monday-Thursday and weekend afternoons anyways. I found a balance that worked for me, and I think you can too.\n\nI took on the grind because I knew that putting in a few months of after work grinding would pay off getting a good tech company would pay off so much more working 60 hours a week for years climbing the ladder in a non-tech company.  That combined with the awful habit of me comparing myself to my peers causing anxiety and how I didn't want to waste spending tens of thousands of dollars on a private school education to get an average job was what motivated me, lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Senior Year:**\n\nNow it was crunch time. I still continued doing a few leetcodes in the beginning of the school year and had done about \\~80 easy and \\~80 mediums and 4 hards total by the end of my preparation, distributed across the categories I mentioned, before I started interviewing. I took an easier class load anticipating a lot of interviews. August-September I focused on doing **mock interviews** while applying to companies through our university job website and finessing the recruiters at the career fair. I gotta say [this video by the TechLead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWvbPIYQPFM&amp;t=1s) was **one of the most influential videos** to demystify the \"thought process\" everyone talks about. I think it's actually more important than if you can get the most optimized solution for the problem. The thought process boils down to talking about **tradeoffs** and having a **bulletproof reason for each line of code** you write. You can't believe how easy it is to impress interviewers when you talk about all the possible ways you can tackle the problem, the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and making your decision of what to use based on the constraints of the problem. **Gayle** was soooo right in CTCI about the thought process and the best conceivable solution as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI probably did about 10 mock interviews with friends, taking turns being the interviewer and the interviewee. **It was interesting being on the other side because it forced you to think about what the interviewer wants to see**. We gave each other medium problems to do with a strict 45 minute time limit. I can't stress how much doing mock interviews helps you develop the skills needed to whiteboard and explain your code as you're coding. I can go into more detail about what I think the interview essentials are, but honestly TechLead's video and CTCI goes over them pretty well, and this post is getting super long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis time I only applied to coveted high-paying companies in cities I wanted to live in maximizing the salary to work-life balance ratio. This included the BigN, a few prop shops in Chicago, and a handful of midsize/unicorn tech companies in SF and Seattle. **I focused my applications on places I had referrals to, companies that came to my career fair, and at the least, companies that were listen on my university job listing page.** I found I would get a much higher chance of getting interviews through these channels rather than spamming applications online. I had referrals to 2/3 BigN's, some prop shops in Chicago came to my school's career fair, and I found a few companies in SF/Seattle in my university job listing page.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I got interviews to 9 companies. I passed the coding challenge, phone screen, and/or on-campus interview for 6 of those companies. I knew I screwed up my first BigN onsite, but one interviewer there gave me the advice that helped me more than anything for the rest of my interviews:\n\n&gt;\"Hey modestbeachhouse, I could tell you were pretty nervous during this interview trying to tackle this hard problem. We don't deduct points for nervous candidates, but remember that every one of these interviews is going to be hard. The sooner you accept that the sooner you can focus on doing your best to solve the problem rather than letting your nerves affect your thought process.\"\n\nDoing my best to follow his advice and be confident, I managed to secure the next few onsites. It is much easier to follow that advice after you get your first offer lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn total, I had 25 technical assessments counting coding challenges, phone screens, technical interviews at onsites. I tried learning what I did good and bad in each one and fixing it for the next one. If you combine that with my \\~10 mock interviews that is about 35 total interviews. The most important algorithms to know are graph traversals, tree traversals, and the sliding window/2 pointer technique in my opinion. Honestly, after practicing the \"thought-process\" it is very possible to at least get an answer even if it's not the most optimized to most questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThe interview grind isn't for everyone. A lot of people hate on it, but it is what it is. For me, it was worth it because I was able to nearly double my compensation from the return offer I had from my previous company, which was around \\~$70k, after several months of grinding, mind COL differences. Not gonna lie though, I did learn a ton throughout this process. I am definitely lucky though that I genuinely enjoy computer science and building things. Everytime I learn a new way to solve a leetcode problem or a design pattern from my internship, I am like \"Holy shit that so cool! Now I can use that new thing I learned for the next thing I build!\" I'm also lucky in a ton of other ways, but I could go on and on. Regardless of the school you go to though, nearly everyone goes through the grind. I remember meeting someone from Waterloo at one of my onsites and he said he cracked open CTCI on his daily commute and did those problems on paper and that's the only reason he got the internships he did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lastly, I definitely could not have done this alone. Recruiting season is hell for everyone.** It is super easy to feel absolutely worthless when you don't get the job you wanted or feel so stupid when you can't understand an interview problem, and I gotta thank my friends and family for being supportive during the lows. **Thank you so much to everyone in** /r/cscareerquestions\\*\\*,\\*\\* [**Jeremy Aguilon**](https://jeremyaguilon.me/)**,** [**TechLead**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xKdmAXFh4ACyhpiQ_3qBw)**, Gayle, and** [**Jarvis**](https://www.youtube.com/user/VSympathyV)**!** I know that reading other people's stories on this sub helped me out a ton, so I figured I'd write one of my own.

Threw my resume out to a lot of companies and even some overseas; Switzerland specifically, because I am a dual citizen and would like to work there some day.\n\nFast forward and I was offered the position without a phone interview, strictly resume. The offer is for $75k/yr + commission (WOWZA). They claim to be expanding very quickly from Europe to the US, and I'm assuming that's why they were okay with a resume + a background check. Can work from anywhere in the US and am responsible for:\n\n-accepting payments from our corporate account\n\n-using the received monetary funds for purchasing products\n\n-providing (sic) with the detailed reports and calculations\n\n-being in touch and following all our instructions instantly\n\n\nSounds easy enough, and I fit the mold, but here is where I think it gets a tad sketchy. This next section is straight from the job offer/description:\n&gt;Money Transfer Details\n\n&gt;You could use any Visa/Mastercard/Amex/Discover credit cards for accepting our payments. We will provide you with the detailed payment instructions to make payments from our corporate account.\n\n&gt;Your personal credit card will be issued right away after you pass the trial (one month) period using your own card(s). We have to make sure that you could handle wholesale purchasing before issuing a company's credit card.\n\n&gt;For security purposes we are not asking our employees for any sensitive information. All we need to know is your approx. balance and the name of the issue bank. This is enough to find a suitable customer for you to work with.\n\n&gt;This type of payment is absolutely safe because all payments and purchases are directed through the Major Credit Company. All payments should be verified before the funds are available. The verification time depends on your credit history and will be reduced by your bank from payment to payment, because your credit score will rise.\n\n&gt;When the funds are posted to your account as an available credit you should let us know and wait for the detailed order instructions from your personal manager. The company's corporate card will be issued when you pass the probationary period. The amount of your personal credit line will depend on the total amount of all orders during the probation period.\n\n\nAm I crazy or is this a solid offer? I just don't like the fact that my own credit card will be involved, but it sounds like the funds will be deposited to my account before I purchase anything. Is there any way this company could pull a bait and switch by posting the available credit to my account, having me make a $5,000 order, then removing the credit from my account?

          "body": "The bar raiser round at Mastercard is typically their most rigorous interview and yes, it absolutely has significant weight in the final decision regardless of how your previous rounds went. This person literally has veto power and is brought in specifically to maintain hiring standards, so they're looking for candidates who exceed the bar rather than just meet it. The coding questions tend to be more complex than earlier rounds - expect medium to hard leetcode-style problems with follow-ups about optimization, edge cases, and alternative approaches. They'll also likely include system design discussions even for non-senior roles, focusing on your thought process and ability to handle ambiguity.\n\nThe behavioral component is just as crucial as the technical parts because the bar raiser is evaluating cultural fit and leadership potential. They'll dig deep into your past experiences with questions about conflict resolution, decision-making under pressure, and times you've had to influence without authority. Come prepared with specific examples that show impact and growth, and be ready to defend your technical choices from previous rounds since they'll have notes from your other interviewers. I actually work on [interview AI](http://interviews.chat), which has helped people prepare for these high-stakes final rounds by practicing both the technical and behavioral components in a realistic setting.",

The interview was really tough — I felt like I was completely roasted, and the manager interviewing me didn’t seem to connect with me at all.\n\nI’ve been applying for jobs on LinkedIn since July — probably close to 1,000 applications by now — and I’ve been lucky enough to get around 10 interviews. But none have led to an offer. Every time, it feels like they find a small loophole or reason not to move forward, even when I thought I did well.\n\nAt this point, I’m really starting to lose hope. I’m trying my best to stay positive, but it’s getting harder with each rejection. I’ve been an auditor for five years at my current firm, which is now going through mass layoffs — and unfortunately, I’m one of those affected.\n\nI truly want to transition into the tech field, but after so many setbacks, I’m starting to wonder if it’s really for me. For those who’ve gone through something similar — how did you stay motivated? What helped you finally break through? Any advice or words of encouragement would mean a lot right now.",

For an analyst role at Mastercard, you can typically expect one or two more rounds after technical - usually a behavioral interview with the hiring manager focusing on situational questions, teamwork scenarios, and how you handle challenges. They might also throw in a case study or business scenario relevant to payments or financial services to see how you think through problems.\n\nThe final round could be with senior leadership or a panel, focusing more on cultural fit, your long-term goals, and how you align with Mastercard's values. Since you've already cleared technical and they've agreed on compensation, they're essentially validating that you're someone they want to work with daily. The fact that the recruiter reached out to you directly and moved quickly through screening suggests they have genuine interest, so stay confident but prepare for behavioral questions about conflict resolution, project management, and adapting to change.

      "body": "I joined this Reddit community a few weeks ago, and it gave me a lot of inspiration during a very stressful time. Thank you all for that. Don't stop posting when you accept an offer! Those, of course, were my favorite posts. :)\n\nHere's a bit of my story. I was laid off from my marketing/communications job about three-and-a-half months ago. Here are the numbers.\n\n* 201 jobs applied to (temp jobs not included)\n* 10% interview rate\n* Average # days until reject email (with no interview): 23.5\n* Number of jobs that rejected me *same day* I applied: 3\n* Average number of days in interview process (application-to-decision time): 38.4 days\n* Number of companies I interviewed with who then ghosted me: 7 \n* Award for longest application-to-decision time: Mastercard at **818 days**! I made this spreadsheet during unemployment. During that time, I got an email from Mastercard saying I was declined for a position I applied to. I looked in my spreadsheet, and I didn't see it listed. So I looked in my emails and searched for Mastercard. I did indeed interview there (with at least three people) for a communications manager role - in 2022. I got my official rejection from them 818 days later! That role is not listed in the 201 applications.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/69j2jpq5qbke1.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdc72537233226ab92e857c4fcb2a8a066c3977b\n\nGeneral Tips:\n\n* Take advantage of any help you're given. I was provided with an outplacement agency, and while at first their advice seemed elementary (\"practice interviewing!\" and \"update your resume!\"), they did have much better advice as time went on.\n* LinkedIn has way more tools than I thought. I thought I was using it well, and I was just a beginner. While I am not sure LinkedIn actually got me the job I accepted, I did appreciate all the lessons I took about how to improve my profile.\n* Track every job in a spreadsheet. I know it sounds tedious, but it helped me so much when I would get a call from a recruiter from a company/role I didn't remember applying to. And the auto-generated emails from companies often don't include the role you even applied to. So those won't help.\n* Create a new email address for job hunting. I didn't do this, and I wish I would have just to compartmentalize better.\n* Nail down your \"about me\" introduction. It's not a reciting of your resume. It's about 30 seconds of you explaining your professional background.\n* Stay as focused as upbeat as possible. I was so close so many times to spiraling, and then I remember a friend told me that there would be days when I would cry, and that's OK. That's when we phone a friend and read fellow Redditor's success stories.\n* [Fellow Redditor's Tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1i8rsiq/got_an_offer_after_65_months_some_tips_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\nHang in there!
