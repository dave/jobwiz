 * Carousel item components for displaying content blocks in the carousel.

 * These components are optimized for carousel display with:
 * - Centered layout
 * - Large typography
 * - Minimal UI chrome
 * - Touch-friendly interactions
 *
 * Note: ContentItem, QuizItem, and ChecklistItem have been deprecated
 * in favor of the conversational components in @/components/alex.
 * Only MediaItem remains as it's still used for video/audio content.
