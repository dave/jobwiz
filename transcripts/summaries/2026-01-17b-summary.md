# Summary: Jan 17, 2026 (Part B) - UX & Implementation

## Key Decision: Framework First
Build the flexible UX/display system BEFORE generating content. Don't worry about data initially—focus on the framework that can display any content type.

## User Journey
1. User searches "Google Product Manager interview"
2. Lands on tailored homepage with company branding/logos
3. Trust signals: "trusted by X people"
4. Progressive disclosure through guided journey

## Paywall Strategy
- **Decision: AB test it** - don't commit to freemium or direct paywall yet
- Option A: Direct paywall - "reassuringly expensive" signals quality
- Option B: Free tier first (general content) - let users try before buying
- Timeline visibility: show full journey map so users see what they're getting

## UX Principles
- **Simplicity**: One thing at a time, not everything on screen
- **Progressive disclosure**: Step-by-step like Lemonade insurance signup
- **Variety in presentation**: Mix of voice, text, multiple choice, infographics, animations
- **Journey first, navigation later**: Initial experience is guided, then allow jumping around
- **Standalone MVP**: No resume/job description upload needed

## Content Block Types (framework must support)
- Video
- Audio clips
- Text blocks
- Big quotes (to hammer home points)
- Infographics
- Animations
- Multiple choice
- Checkboxes

## Module Types
- General job interview skills (potentially free)
- Company-specific (e.g., Google module)
- Role-specific (e.g., software engineering)
- Company+role specific for major employers (e.g., Google software engineering)

## Content Ideas
- Company trivia: "When was Google started? Who founded it?"
- Phone screen basics
- Interview stage expectations (3-5 interviews, what each tests)

## Technical Approach
- **Framework first, content later**
- Use AI to design module structure (ask "what should go in a general jobs module?")
- Careful prompting to avoid AI-generated feel
- Keep it simple

## Key Quote
"We teach people how to pass interviews. All this stuff can probably be found elsewhere, but people will enjoy it being organized and easy to digest."
