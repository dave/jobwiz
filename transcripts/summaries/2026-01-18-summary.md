# Summary: Jan 18, 2026 - Module & Content Structure

## Core Architecture

User goes through modules sequentially for their company/role:
1. **General module** (free) - Universal interview prep
2. **Company module** - Company-specific culture, values
3. **Role module** - Role-specific skills, questions
4. **Industry module** (if applicable)

Hit paywall after general module, then continue through premium content.

## Content Block Types

Each module contains a list of items (carousel-style navigation):
- Text blocks
- Quotes/phrases (popup style)
- Video
- Audio clips
- Multiple choice questions
- Interview question explanations (with dedicated UI)
- Infographics
- Animated elements
- Graphs

**Key point**: Mix up content types to avoid "text, text, text" fatigue.

## UX Principles

- **Clean UI**: Progress not shown on every page
- **Questions**: Show question + answers + next button only
- **Progress**: Visible on dashboard (before/after), not during flow
- **Navigation**: Click through items, finish module, move to next
- **End state**: See progress, return to previous sections

## Paywall Placement

AB test to determine optimal paywall location.

## Current State Assessment

Data exists in multiple places:
- `questions` table - Interview questions with metadata
- Trivia questions - Location unclear
- Other bits and pieces scattered

**Action needed**: Audit codebase to summarize what data exists and plans for additional data sources.

## Key Insight

> "The UI at the moment is nothing like what I planned it to be."

Current implementation doesn't match the vision of:
- Modules with lists of mixed-type items
- Carousel/presentation-style navigation
- Clean, focused single-item display

## Next Steps

1. Restructure UI to match module/item architecture
2. Each item = different content type
3. Get basics working, then focus on populating modules with data
