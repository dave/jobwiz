# Summary: Jan 16, 2026 - Initial Concept Discussion

## Core Idea
Educational website helping people pass job interviews at specific companies (Spotify, Microsoft, P&G, etc.)

## Business Model
- Google Ads targeting specific company+role combinations (e.g., "pass Spotify interview")
- Dedicated URLs per company/role (e.g., passthespotifyinterview.com)
- One-time payment (~$200) to unlock premium content
- Target market: people in "panic mode" after getting an interview

## Content Structure
- **Generic modules**: Common interview prep applicable to all jobs
- **Company modules**: Culture, values (e.g., Spotify culture module)
- **Industry modules**: Pharmaceutical interview questions, tech questions
- **Role modules**: Marketing, engineering, etc.
- Matrix system maps modules to specific positions
- ~20 modules could cover ~500 different positions

## Key Insights
- Previous success with airline pilot interview prep during major hiring push
- Focus on high-value roles with large hiring drives
- Overlap between modules reduces content creation burden
- AI used to generate marketing materials and new modules

## Research Tasks Identified
1. Google Trends research on company+job title searches
2. Deep research on hiring patterns (seasonal hiring drives, mass recruitment)
3. Research interview processes at target companies
4. Investigate sesame.ai for voice integration

## Open Questions
- Free tier vs. paywall upfront?
- App vs. website only?
- How to differentiate from ChatGPT giving free advice?
