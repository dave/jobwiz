# Summary: Jan 17, 2026 (Part A) - Content Strategy

## Key Insight: Psychology Over Questions
Don't just list interview questions - explain WHY interviewers ask them and what they're really trying to learn about the candidate.

## Content Approach
- Teach candidates to understand interviewer's true intent
- Sometimes the best answer isn't a direct answer to the question
- Focus on what interviewers "need" vs. what they "ask"
- Education about interview dynamics, not just practice questions

## UX Direction
- **Story/journey format** rather than dashboard
- Progressive walkthrough: "Here's what will happen in your interviews"
- Explain each interview stage and its purpose:
  - "This interview tests how you react under pressure"
  - "This one evaluates teamwork"
- Slideshow/guided experience to start

## Features Discussed
- Progress tracking: green ticks for completed sections, red crosses for incomplete
- Dashboard for jumping between sections (after initial journey)
- Future feature: LinkedIn research on interviewer (interests, recent posts for rapport building)

## Template Flexibility
- Can't always predict exact interview stages at companies like Google
- Allow users to customize their interview prep plan
- Add/remove interview stages as they learn more about their process

## Reference
- John mentioned previous work called "YZ" that had good approach
