John Brophy: Okay. Uh, it's recording. Go on. Right. Um, so, uh, what we've done as a kind of, um, um, quick quick and dirty thing is is nice, but, um, it it gives a we've obviously got some data there. We've thought about what we're going to be teaching people, but I think it needs to be presented slightly differently. Um uh for example um what we need to do is explain to people why we're asking them to come up with these questions. Um for example um what what I think is great is if you say to someone look this is the question that the interview is going to ask you but what they really want from you is something slightly different. So we need to explain to people uh the the kind of process that that is going through the interviewer's mind and that's slightly different to just saying hey here's some questions you need to write answers to these. We need to say look this is what is happening on the day of the interview. The interviewer wants to learn certain things about you and he's gonna try and prompt you to reveal certain things about you by asking you questions and trying to get you to answer them.


00:01:29

John Brophy: And sometimes you have to think uh less about the answer to the question that they're asking you and you have to think about what they're actually trying to get out of you. And sometimes it's it's better to answer a different question or to say something completely different rather than the answer to the question because you know what the interviewer is trying to get out of you. Um I'm not sure on exactly how is best to present this on a website. Um but um but yeah, that's something we're going to need to research and and work out. It's more of a psychological thing. um and trying to work out what is really kind of behind the scenes of what the interviewer is trying to get you to say and what he what he wants out of you or what he needs out of you or not just what he's what he's asking you but what answer is going to be uh more likely for you to get the job kind of thing. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think just like a list of um list of questions to answer.


00:02:43

John Brophy: Um I mean, I think that is probably part of what we've got to do, but there needs to be a a big section at the top that says, "Look, you're going to you're you're doing an interview at this company. The interviewer is going to, you know, the first interview is going to be um you know, such and such. you know, there's going to be different interviews and with different people and they're trying to get different kind of things out of you. We need to educate these people on what to expect in the different interviews and how to steer the interview to what the interviewer wants or what the interviewer needs. Um so it's more of a education of what's happening rather than just a um you know a bunch of questions and and trying to trying to practice questions. Um it's more kind of an education of what happens in interviews. So at when you kind of open up the dashboard, are we going to specify the different types of interviews and stages that would be Yeah, I think less of a dashboard and more of a story, you know, a process like it's it's like it's like this is, you know, there'll be a maybe it's just a a a sort of slideshow that you start with where it's like, hey, you're going for a job.


00:04:10

John Brophy: This is what's going to happen. you're going to have this interview, you're going to have this interview, and you're going to have this interview probably. Um, and then it'll be like, in this interview, the person is is trying to actually work out how how you react under pressure, and in the next interview, he's going to work out how you work as a team. And uh or or there'll be questions about this and questions about that. And you know when you you'll you'll be able to um understand you'll be able to like figure out what the sort of question is that he's asking um and what he's actually trying to get by thinking about the the the for you know the um how he's asking the question. Um, so yeah, you know what? I should I should find what we did what I did with YZ because it was actually really good. I don't know if it's anywhere. Where is it? Let me find it. I still think you're going to need like some kind of dashboard to be able to jump in and out of.


00:05:25

John Brophy: And you know, once you've done the first interview, you need to kind of cross it off. And once you've learned the questions to, you know, what the questions are asking, you need to be able to sort of tick that off and get the green ticks and get, you know, have the red crosses on stuff you haven't learned. Yeah. Um, I also like the idea maybe in a future version of uh taking the LinkedIn of the person who's interviewing you and going off and looking at their Twitter about what they've been talking about recently and having something, you know, if they posted about a football team in the last three days or something like that, you can have a, hey, they support this mention that in the intro just to sort of build that, hey, this is cool and knows me. So maybe you can do a bit of research on uh the person that's interviewing you. So like I I I'm not sure we're going to be able to exactly say these are the five interviews you're going to get if you get a Google gig. M so it may be we have a template of like hey this is what you might potentially have at Google but if you've got diff a different template then you might be able to add I've got this interview coming up and I've got this interview coming up into your kind of like interview prep plan.
