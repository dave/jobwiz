Uh, yeah, like, my re naming it, beside, and how to lay on the site, and... how the UX will work. So let's think about the UX. Whose journey you will work?  It's really, really good kind of thing. Like my search, like the primary way of getting in is I search for Google Product Manager, and it's for the 1st result on Google somehow, or it's somewhere. So I land on this beautiful homepage that's very tailored, like, with Google logos and stuff.  Yeah. Hey, we have the best resource of Google questions. Yeah.  And... I think it may be explaining, like, how we're better than everyone else, somehow. Yeah.  Trusted by a bunch of people. Yeah. I kind of think we just go straight through to a paper and paper page.  I think we'll get beaten, Matt. Do you think? I don't know.  I don't think we, I think... You don't want any free? I mean...  I mean... I don't think that works in this day and age, but maybe, if it looks really professional.... I mean, say, you know, if we kind of make it, make it out that we've, we've got inside the information and we're gonna, you know, really be an easy...  I mean, we'll probably get complaints from people saying, well, actually, it's not very good.. But... I mean...  I think people... when they go for a job, they're just, like, panicking, aren't they? So they want to just spend some money. Yeah, maybe...  I think... Well maybe not. They think ours, if they're paying, it's, like, reassuringly expensive. right?  If they're actually paying for something, it's gonna be more useful than something that's free. I don't know. It's always gone.  It's extra. Okay, so let's say they, we managed to get them through the payroll. The thing is, if we give them free stuff, which is exactly the same as what they can find.  You're asking ChatGPT, you better... You win for us? I don't think...  Well, I mean, maybe if you give it the nonspecific Google question. For, like, general product manager questions, and, like... I mean, I, personally, would never put 100 bucks into something I had to try.  Right. ever. But I'm not the target audience. Maybe.  Maybe. I don't know. It doesn't matter.  We can figure out whether the pay will... You know, we can AB test it. I think landing somewhere on a landing page with lots of things for you to choose or choose from, this kind of thing.  Like, we, I think, instead, it needs to be a kind of journey that I work for. Right. Like, first, we're going to tell them about stuff.  So progressive, progressive disclosure. Yeah, rather than everything on the screen at once. Right.  And then say, what we're going to do is we're going to take you through this journey of learning about this interview process, how you can optimize your... your chances... A bit like the lemonade insurance sign up. Have you ever done that?  No, I haven't. It's amazing. Right.  Like, it's just one bit by the next bit, by the next bit, by the next bit. Like, made them. Yeah, yeah.  I think it's sort of step by step thing. And then, not all the same, these things are, like, maybe there's a, you know, a voiced thing, actually talking to you, and then there's, like, a bunch of text, you can read, and tender about, and then there's something which is a modern choice, something or other, and then some tick boxes or something. Yeah.  And then it kind of alternates. as to how how these modules are structured. I think, at the moment, I've just said to it, do what it wants, and it's done it as simply as possible. Right, exactly.  Like, they plug and play kind of coarse layout. Yeah. Yeah.  So I think we need to make it a little bit more flexible, and maybe at the moment, to start, we don't actually put any data in it. We just work on... This kind of framework.  Please, I don't know. And I can do the devil data separately. Um...  A framework for learning anything. I know, framework for what we want. But just without worrying too much about putting the data in now.  Because, say, look, we've got this thing which can display videos or videos. It can display... Oh, good.  You know, audio clips, you can display nice, little, you know, sometimes it might just be a fray, you know, a... a big text saying, you know, quote from someone or something, you know? No. When we really want to hammer home a point.  You know? Yeah. Instead of, you know, just being a big, long list of things are exactly the same.  Thank you so much. Just have it as more an interactive journey. Uh...  Yeah, yeah. And maybe, you know, things with, like, infographics and animated things. Yeah.  So I think, then I think the... You could have the first sort of part of that free. Yeah.  Right? The first 10 steps of it for you. Yeah.  So you kind of understand... Yeah, sure. The map.  Right, well, maybe the, yeah, well, maybe the first bit is just general job stuff, and it's like, you're the general job staff of this thing. Next is the Google specific stuff. Next is the Google.  Right, and you can see the timeline. Exactly. yeah. What?  Yeah, that'd be good. Yep. Yep.  I like that. Okay. But simplicity, right?  That's the key. Yeah. Like, not a thousand things on the screen at once.  Yes, exactly. One thing at a time, I don't think they need to be... I mean, afterwards, we can let them go through any part of it, and we recap in part of it, but to start with, it should be just a journey, then clicking through something, just absorbing it.  Yeah. I guess if we know your last name, first name, last name, we can start tailoring some of it to you, and... Oh, my God. shut up.  But it's, like, it has to be very specific to the job, right? And to the company. Yeah, like, the Google one, it's called test one. gonna be like that.  Google module, right? And a software engineering module. And maybe, you know, Google's a special case, so maybe a Google software engineering module.  You know, it's very specific to all the software engineering, but if it's like a non Google thing, then you might get the company module and your software engineer module. And that, you know, that'll do, because it's a, you know, standard position that we don't know much about. I guess, like, when was Google started?  Who started Google? Like, all that sort of stuff is kind of good to know, isn't it? Yeah, yeah.  And that's just simple questions and logical choice. Right. Yeah.  Like, getting through that phone screen, you have to know all that bullshit. Right. Yeah.  Yeah, so this is, like, stuff for the modules. But, yeah, this all needs to be research and things, but, I don't know, maybe we should concentrate on, like, the, shall we concentrate on? I mean, I think... putting it together, once we've got the weight on it is relatively not, like, it's not exactly rocket science, like...  But do we need to figure out what the date, the format, the data, we can get the data into? Well, that's the thing. I mean, whether, I mean, can we actually get that really good data that will make this thing actually useful is a question?  you know? It's like, maybe your states are actually, it's pretty hard to get, and it'll just feel shit. like, hey, I rubbish. Yeah.  Got it. You've got to make sure that it's not slow. So how do we do that?  I think it's down to us to work out the correct prompting mechanism. Yeah, and sort of, instead of just letting it go with a, you know, we don't want it to look like it's been generated, so we were, like, actually... So, I don't know, maybe we need to talk to people that, you know, their own recruitment, that might have input or something, maybe, or... just be able to get ourselves.  When I think, talking to the AIs about Rick Roman, it's gonna be as good as talking to someone in recruitment about it. Yeah, yeah, true. Yeah.  Um... Yeah, so, so maybe we get, we get the AI to design each of these modules, just say, look, we have a module about general jobs. What do you recommend we put in it?  We're also gonna have modules about the individual companies and the individual positions. So this is, like, generally what to do in a job interview and blah, blah, blah, blah. And then, and then maybe you can do, you know, you can kind of design it kind of step by step.  So, what, normal people, if you don't go to many jobs, you just need to know about trouble disease. And maybe we don't need the whole... You are at this stage, it's more just a course of, like, anyone that is thinking about getting a job at Google, they could take the course, even if you don't have an interview, you could still take the course, right?  Like, it's... what you need to get you through, Google. Yeah. Yeah, I think, like, I think, like, getting, you know, in Google module, will probably be, like, uh, do, you really, organize, 3, 4, 5 interviews, whatever, uh, we'll...  This is what to expect in one, two, three, four. Yeah. Okay.  Okay. I hope this worked. Looks like it's working, doesn't it?  Hmm? It looks like it's picking up our voice.. Hmm.  Um... How you? What else does it need?  Do you want to upload your resume, Taylor? Do it? Do you want to upload the job description?  Do it? Like, you don't want to do any of that. You just want it to be stand alone.  At the moment, the one... is... would be good to have, just as simple as possible. Yeah. This, I mean, I need to do that.  We teach people how to pass music.. And all this stuff can probably be found elsewhere, but maybe people will enjoy it being economized, easy to digest. Sauce.  All right. Happy.
