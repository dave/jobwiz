John Brophy: We're transcribing everything. Um, okay. John, this is John and Dave Brophie talking about um our idea to create a educational website that helps you pass or learn about how to get a job at specific companies through interviews. Yeah. So, it's going to what you're going to you there's going to be a Google advert and it's going to say learn how to pass the job interview at Spotify or learn how to pass the IT programmer job interview at Microsoft or it's going to say learn how to pass the marketing interview at Proctor and Gamble or there's going to be a hundred different or a thousand different variations or 10,000 10,000 maybe and each one is going to lead you to a different URL and it's going to be like pass the Spotify interview.com or pass the it microsoftinterview.com and it's going to then give you a whole bunch of things which are going to help you pass your interview. uh some of which are going to be very generic that are going to be applying to all interviews and all jobs and they're going to be common across all of the the different variations.


00:01:33

John Brophy: And then some are going to be let's say there's going to be some a module about Spotify culture and that will be common amongst all of the Spotify uh positions and there might be one about there might be a module about pharmaceutical interview questions that are common between all pharmaceutical companies and the secret source to this is going to be the uh the nice marketing materials that we have to sell it and the framework that will allow us to use AI to create new uh modules that will then uh power extra um specific um interview preparation courses. Yeah, I think it's worth us doing a bit of like deep research into uh the thing the courses or the jobs at the specific companies that we think are going to have the most traffic on Google. We can maybe put together some research into that. M um I mean I think I did something like this in the past with airline interviews with a friend of mine and it worked because there was a specific company that was having a massive hiring push. they were hiring like a thousand pilots and over the next year or two years that we ran it um that that would just be the the um there was hundreds and hundreds of people that were getting interviews to to be pilots at this specific company.


00:03:15

John Brophy: And so, you know, there may be the same kind of thing where, you know, companies are having hiring drives and really expanding and maybe we should sort of concentrate on them, right? But I think the what I what I really like about this is that it there is so much overlap between um the interview prep for different companies and different types of position and different industries that you can do these sort of possibly more generic modules that will really help people in these different uh situations. And they would mean that you wouldn't have to do um a lot of there doesn't need to be that much tailored kind of doesn't need to be that tailored to each individual thing. You may have like 20 different modules that would cover uh 500 different individual positions and then each of those individual positions could have a different set of marketing materials that would really uh sell the course to people. Right? And there's a lot of universal information across the courses that can only we can build it once. Yeah. And I think I think when people get an interview for a job, they immediately go into panic mode and they would be very very easy targets to to to bite to um to to you know spend a bit of money to get an edge.


00:04:43

John Brophy: But it's a one-off payment, right? It's not a subscription or anything like that. It's a oneoff unlock this extra functionality that yeah, I think a couple hundred bucks and and you get a you get a a bit of an edge. Um and maybe all this stuff is is already in the public domain. Maybe chatbt will tell you all of this stuff. Um but still um it will u be useful. That's my idea anyway. Yeah. Um, what other like what like that's a the idea. Is there any research we want to do around the idea? Can we do some Google trend like research around the type of things people are asking Google for? Like can we do Google trend research on company name and job title? See which of the sort of popular companies and job titles are getting asked for the most. Yeah, that's an idea. So, we can do some analysis around that. Um, what else? Like think about universal question like how to pass a job interview.


00:05:59

John Brophy: what questions get asked in every one of those interviews versus what are more tailored and unique across kind of the different highlevel industries tech product engineering. H I think it's also uh maybe we need to research how the interview process at these for these in for each in type of position uh goes on because we were when I did this before it was just a specific company with a specific job position and we knew that there was going to be uh one face toface interview one practical interview which was which was actually in a sort of simulator later and then one interview which you know one other type of interview. So it's it's also about educating them in what to expect on the day of the interview which you may which they may not know about and that's something that we'd need to kind of research for each individual sort of company I guess. Yeah, maybe we can do some deep research into um specific sort of hiring patterns like you know are there any big yearly hirings that happen where people are you know where a thousand people are being interviewed for a specific thing and it's like a high value role.


00:07:20

John Brophy: Can we find, you know, that that Dave's example is from a pilot's license thing where he kind of got in and knew some of the pilots like we need to find some specific stuff like that that would potentially be high value like very high value jobs where people need help and there's lots of people going for the job and and place places where places where we can help, you know, where we can give them a bit of an edge over the other people in the you. Yeah. What else? Um I mean I don't think the the the the framework for it is that difficult. Just it can just be a website which which has a bit of a um it just needs to be a very simple website really where where you have some marketing materials then you have a payw wall then you have a bunch of um materials that you can read and then maybe some test questions and and uh it doesn't need to be anything special. I don't think it needs an app or anything.


00:08:24

John Brophy: It just needs websites. I I don't know if I agree. Like I feel like there's the there's definitely a free side to it which could be like a question bank of question and answers and then I think you get them addicted to that. You then premium upsell them into something that is more substantial than just the questions, right? They can get the questions for free. Everyone has a chat GPT account. They can tell a chat GPT to do something for them. I I think we need something above and beyond for the premium upsell, right? It's not just give me more questions. It's But I I think I think we have to I think we're in in a nice market here because people do kind of panic when they get a job interview and they are more than willing to spend a couple hundred bucks on something if it's going to give them an edge. So maybe it doesn't need it doesn't need as much of a it's more of a numbers game of getting as many of these things out there and yeah maybe I don't I don't know if it needs like a free layer and and stuff.


00:09:28

John Brophy: It might it might still sell as just a hey couple hundred bucks to get an edge in this interview. Maybe you've got this interview in three days. Have you done enough prep for it? You know, I still think getting them in and sort of showing them the app is better than just asking them for money up front. Maybe I never if something ask me for money up front, I just never do it. Right. Even if I'm stressed or panicking, you need to see the product before you can go for it. Um, yeah. What else? So we would create modules and we would get other people that have specialist knowledge of the industry to create modules. And a module might be a specific company or it might be something for a specific industry or it might be something for a specific role in any industry. or it might be something might be something that's yeah something that would apply to lots of different positions and then we'd have some kind of matrix that would apply the the modules to each individual position and then there would be some we would use AI to create marketing materials that would uh that would be like a homepage that would um would get people in and then we'd have um some kind of uh system that would run the um Google ads um that would uh place the Google ads and and monitor the performance. Yeah, I think um uh the premium service could include some kind of voice integration. Do some research into sesame.ai, which is a voice service.
